1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:09,956
[SOUND]
So,

2
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:14,850
looking at the text mining problem more
closely, we see that the problem is

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:20,300
similar to general data mining, except
that we'll be focusing more on text data.

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,400
And we're going to have text mining
algorithms to help us to turn text data

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,240
into actionable knowledge that
we can use in real world,

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,130
especially for decision making, or

7
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,350
for completing whatever tasks that
require text data to support.

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,000
Because, in general,
in many real world problems of data mining

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,720
we also tend to have other kinds
of data that are non-textual.

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,950
So a more general picture would be
to include non-text data as well.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,875
And for this reason we might be
concerned with joint mining of text and

12
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,060
non-text data.

13
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,860
And so in this course we're
going to focus more on text mining,

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,628
but we're also going to also touch how do
to joint analysis of both text data and

15
00:01:10,628 --> 00:01:12,450
non-text data.

16
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,630
With this problem definition we
can now look at the landscape of

17
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,419
the topics in text mining and analytics.

18
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,770
Now this slide shows the process of
generating text data in more detail.

19
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:29,800
More specifically, a human sensor or

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,420
human observer would look at
the word from some perspective.

21
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,820
Different people would be looking at
the world from different angles and

22
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,210
they'll pay attention to different things.

23
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,090
The same person at different times might
also pay attention to different aspects

24
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,990
of the observed world.

25
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,450
And so the humans are able to perceive
the world from some perspective.

26
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,480
And that human, the sensor,
would then form a view of the world.

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,150
And that can be called the Observed World.

28
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,040
Of course, this would be different from
the Real World because of the perspective

29
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,830
that the person has taken
can often be biased also.

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,642
Now the Observed World can be
represented as, for example,

31
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:27,535
entity-relation graphs or
in a more general way,

32
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:31,890
using knowledge representation language.

33
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:39,190
But in general, this is basically what
a person has in mind about the world.

34
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,800
And we don't really know what
exactly it looks like, of course.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,250
But then the human would
express what the person has

36
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,920
observed using a natural language,
such as English.

37
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,760
And the result is text data.

38
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,610
Of course a person could have used
a different language to express what he or

39
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,660
she has observed.

40
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:08,220
In that case we might have text data of
mixed languages or different languages.

41
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,790
The main goal of text mining
Is actually to revert this

42
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,280
process of generating text data.

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,480
We hope to be able to uncover
some aspect in this process.

44
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,480
Specifically, we can think about mining,
for example, knowledge about the language.

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,130
And that means by looking at text data
in English, we may be able to discover

46
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:46,310
something about English, some usage
of English, some patterns of English.

47
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,340
So this is one type of mining problems,
where the result is

48
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,100
some knowledge about language which
may be useful in various ways.

49
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,620
If you look at the picture,

50
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,380
we can also then mine knowledge
about the observed world.

51
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,030
And so this has much to do with
mining the content of text data.

52
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,640
We're going to look at what the text
data are about, and then try to

53
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,820
get the essence of it or
extracting high quality information

54
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,600
about a particular aspect of
the world that we're interested in.

55
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,890
For example, everything that has been
said about a particular person or

56
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,630
a particular entity.

57
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,550
And this can be regarded as mining content

58
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:43,330
to describe the observed world in
the user's mind or the person's mind.

59
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,060
If you look further,
then you can also imagine

60
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,710
we can mine knowledge about this observer,
himself or herself.

61
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,630
So this has also to do with
using text data to infer

62
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,270
some properties of this person.

63
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,410
And these properties could
include the mood of the person or

64
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,010
sentiment of the person.

65
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,250
And note that we distinguish
the observed word from the person

66
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:21,040
because text data can't describe what the
person has observed in an objective way.

67
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,960
But the description can be also
subjected with sentiment and so,

68
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,280
in general, you can imagine the text
data would contain some factual

69
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,770
descriptions of the world plus
some subjective comments.

70
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,330
So that's why it's also possible to

71
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,970
do text mining to mine
knowledge about the observer.

72
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,980
Finally, if you look at the picture
to the left side of this picture,

73
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,150
then you can see we can certainly also
say something about the real world.

74
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,880
Right?

75
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,860
So indeed we can do text mining to
infer other real world variables.

76
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,220
And this is often called
a predictive analytics.

77
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,000
And we want to predict the value
of certain interesting variable.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,935
So, this picture basically covered

79
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:13,440
multiple types of knowledge that
we can mine from text in general.

80
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,260
When we infer other
real world variables we

81
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,990
could also use some of the results from

82
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,910
mining text data as intermediate
results to help the prediction.

83
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,940
For example,

84
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,050
after we mine the content of text data we
might generate some summary of content.

85
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,190
And that summary could be then used

86
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,003
to help us predict the variables
of the real world.

87
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:51,940
Now of course this is still generated
from the original text data,

88
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:58,410
but I want to emphasize here that
often the processing of text data

89
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,780
to generate some features that can help
with the prediction is very important.

90
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,100
And that's why here we show the results of

91
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,010
some other mining tasks, including
mining the content of text data and

92
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,520
mining knowledge about the observer,
can all be very helpful for prediction.

93
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,690
In fact, when we have non-text data,
we could also use the non-text

94
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,496
data to help prediction, and
of course it depends on the problem.

95
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:39,260
In general, non-text data can be very
important for such prediction tasks.

96
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,530
For example,
if you want to predict stock prices or

97
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,870
changes of stock prices based on
discussion in the news articles or

98
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,730
in social media, then this is an example

99
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,520
of using text data to predict
some other real world variables.

100
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,950
But in this case, obviously,

101
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,480
the historical stock price data would
be very important for this prediction.

102
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,633
And so that's an example of
non-text data that would be very

103
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:13,750
useful for the prediction.

104
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,161
And we're going to combine both kinds
of data to make the prediction.

105
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:24,510
Now non-text data can be also used for
analyzing text by supplying context.

106
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,050
When we look at the text data alone,

107
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,770
we'll be mostly looking at the content
and/or opinions expressed in the text.

108
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,149
But text data generally also
has context associated.

109
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:44,150
For example, the time and the location
that associated are with the text data.

110
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,500
And these are useful context information.

111
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,020
And the context can provide interesting
angles for analyzing text data.

112
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,980
For example, we might partition text
data into different time periods

113
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,680
because of the availability of the time.

114
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,480
Now we can analyze text data in each
time period and then make a comparison.

115
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,970
Similarly we can partition text
data based on locations or

116
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,920
any meta data that's associated to
form interesting comparisons in areas.

117
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,980
So, in this sense,
non-text data can actually provide

118
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,580
interesting angles or
perspectives for text data analysis.

119
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,340
And it can help us make context-sensitive

120
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,680
analysis of content or
the language usage or

121
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:42,920
the opinions about the observer or
the authors of text data.

122
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,920
We could analyze the sentiment
in different contexts.

123
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:54,500
So this is a fairly general landscape of
the topics in text mining and analytics.

124
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,850
In this course we're going to
selectively cover some of those topics.

125
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,796
We actually hope to cover
most of these general topics.

126
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:11,321
First we're going to cover
natural language processing very

127
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:16,053
briefly because this has to do
with understanding text data and

128
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:21,580
this determines how we can represent
text data for text mining.

129
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:27,870
Second, we're going to talk about how to
mine word associations from text data.

130
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,340
And word associations is a form of use for
lexical knowledge about a language.

131
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,340
Third, we're going to talk about
topic mining and analysis.

132
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,190
And this is only one way to
analyze content of text, but

133
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,100
it's a very useful ways
of analyzing content.

134
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,400
It's also one of the most useful
techniques in text mining.

135
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:59,510
Then we're going to talk about
opinion mining and sentiment analysis.

136
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,250
So this can be regarded as one example
of mining knowledge about the observer.

137
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,510
And finally we're going to
cover text-based prediction

138
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,020
problems where we try to predict some
real world variable based on text data.

139
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,880
So this slide also serves as
a road map for this course.

140
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,554
And we're going to use
this as an outline for

141
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,962
the topics that we'll cover
in the rest of this course.

142
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:40,962
