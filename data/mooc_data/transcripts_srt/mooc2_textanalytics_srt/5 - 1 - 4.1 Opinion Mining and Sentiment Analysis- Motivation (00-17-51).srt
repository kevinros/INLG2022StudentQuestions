00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,628
[SOUND] This lecture is about,

2
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:11,073
Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis,

3
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:15,133
covering, Motivation.

4
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,208
In this lecture,
we're going to start, talking about,

5
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,170
mining a different kind of knowledge.

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,150
Namely, knowledge about the observer or
humans that have generated the text data.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,070
In particular, we're going to talk about
the opinion mining and sentiment analysis.

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,540
As we discussed earlier, text data
can be regarded as data generated

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,573
from humans as subjective sensors.

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:50,880
In contrast, we have other devices such
as video recorder that can report what's

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,670
happening in the real world objective to
generate the viewer data for example.

12
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,495
Now the main difference between test
data and other data, like video data,

13
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:10,440
is that it has rich opinions,

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,720
and the content tends to be subjective
because it's generated from humans.

15
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:22,170
Now, this is actually a unique advantaged
of text data, as compared with other data,

16
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,190
because the office is a great
opportunity to understand the observers.

17
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,740
We can mine text data to
understand their opinions.

18
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,024
Understand people's preferences,
how people think about something.

19
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:43,155
So this lecture and the following lectures
will be mainly about how we can mine and

20
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:47,775
analyze opinions buried
in a lot of text data.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,036
So let's start with
the concept of opinion.

22
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:57,580
It's not that easy to
formally define opinion, but

23
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,340
mostly we would define
opinion as a subjective

24
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,000
statement describing what a person
believes or thinks about something.

25
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,140
Now, I highlighted quite a few words here.

26
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,480
And that's because it's worth thinking
a little bit more about these words.

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,160
And that will help us better
understand what's in an opinion.

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,370
And this further helps us to
define opinion more formally.

29
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,990
Which is always needed to computation to
resolve the problem of opinion mining.

30
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,390
So let's first look at the key
word of subjective here.

31
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,579
This is in contrast with objective
statement or factual statement.

32
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,130
Those statements can be proved right or
wrong.

33
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,470
And this is a key differentiating
factor from opinions

34
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,520
which tends to be not
easy to prove wrong or

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,960
right, because it reflects what
the person thinks about something.

36
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:06,640
So in contrast, objective statement can
usually be proved wrong or correct.

37
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:15,170
For example, you might say this
computer has a screen and a battery.

38
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,600
Now that's something you can check.

39
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,200
It's either having a battery or not.

40
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,820
But in contrast with this, think about
the sentence such as, this laptop has

41
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:34,950
the best battery or
this laptop has a nice screen.

42
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,629
Now these statements
are more subjective and

43
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:43,290
it's very hard to prove
whether it's wrong or correct.

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,000
So opinion, is a subjective statement.

45
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,450
And next lets look at
the keyword person here.

46
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,940
And that indicates that
is an opinion holder.

47
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,310
Because when we talk about opinion,
it's about an opinion held by someone.

48
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,660
And then we notice that
there is something here.

49
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,860
So that is the target of the opinion.

50
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,810
The opinion is expressed
on this something.

51
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,780
And now, of course, believes or
thinks implies that

52
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,010
an opinion will depend on the culture or
background and the context in general.

53
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,760
Because a person might think
different in a different context.

54
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,690
People from different background
may also think in different ways.

55
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,240
So this analysis shows that there are
multiple elements that we need to include

56
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,580
in order to characterize opinion.

57
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,470
So, what's a basic opinion
representation like?

58
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,830
Well, it should include at
least three elements, right?

59
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,520
Firstly, it has to specify
what's the opinion holder.

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,220
So whose opinion is this?

61
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,720
Second, it must also specify the target,
what's this opinion about?

62
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,830
And third, of course,
we want opinion content.

63
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,830
And so what exactly is opinion?

64
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,160
If you can identify these,

65
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,750
we get a basic understanding of opinion
and can already be useful sometimes.

66
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,130
You want to understand further,
we want enriched opinion representation.

67
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,500
And that means we also want to
understand that, for example,

68
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,740
the context of the opinion and
what situation was the opinion expressed.

69
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,290
For example, what time was it expressed?

70
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:32,310
We, also, would like to, people understand
the opinion sentiment, and this is

71
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:39,370
to understand that what the opinion tells
us about the opinion holder's feeling.

72
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,660
For example, is this opinion positive,
or negative?

73
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,911
Or perhaps the opinion holder was happy or
was sad, and

74
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:52,813
so such understanding obvious
to those beyond just Extracting

75
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:56,527
the opinion content,
it needs some analysis.

76
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:03,860
So let's take a simple
example of a product review.

77
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,350
In this case, this actually expressed the
opinion holder, and expressed the target.

78
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,140
So its obviously whats opinion holder and

79
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,860
that's just reviewer and its also often
very clear whats the opinion target and

80
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,340
that's the product review for
example iPhone 6.

81
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,210
When the review is posted usually
you can't such information easier.

82
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,540
Now the content, of course,
is a review text that's, in general,

83
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,290
also easy to obtain.

84
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,920
So you can see product reviews are fairly

85
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,640
easy to analyze in terms of obtaining
a basic opinion of representation.

86
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,730
But of course, if you want to get more
information, you might know the Context,

87
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,300
for example.

88
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,170
The review was written in 2015.

89
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:57,190
Or, we want to know that the sentiment
of this review is positive.

90
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:02,499
So, this additional understanding of
course adds value to mining the opinions.

91
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,060
Now, you can see in this case the task
is relatively easy and that's

92
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,789
because the opinion holder and the opinion
target have already been identified.

93
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,230
Now let's take a look at
the sentence in the news.

94
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,410
In this case, we have a implicit
holder and a implicit target.

95
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,990
And the tasker is in general harder.

96
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,700
So, we can identify opinion holder here,
and that's the governor of Connecticut.

97
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,710
We can also identify the target.

98
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,160
So one target is Hurricane Sandy, but

99
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,920
there is also another target
mentioned which is hurricane of 1938.

100
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,850
So what's the opinion?

101
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,660
Well, there's a negative sentiment here

102
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,029
that's indicated by words like bad and
worst.

103
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,270
And we can also, then, identify context,
New England in this case.

104
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,300
Now, unlike in the playoff review,

105
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,370
all these elements must be extracted by
using natural RAM processing techniques.

106
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,100
So, the task Is much harder.

107
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,020
And we need a deeper natural
language processing.

108
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,200
And these examples also

109
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,260
suggest that a lot of work can be
easy to done for product reviews.

110
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,896
That's indeed what has happened.

111
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:29,170
Analyzing and
assembling news is still quite difficult,

112
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:34,150
it's more difficult than the analysis
of opinions in product reviews.

113
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,330
Now there are also some other
interesting variations.

114
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,152
In fact, here we're going to
examine the variations of opinions,

115
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:44,080
more systematically.

116
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,150
First, let's think about
the opinion holder.

117
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,870
The holder could be an individual or
it could be group of people.

118
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,190
Sometimes, the opinion
was from a committee.

119
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,060
Or from a whole country of people.

120
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,770
Opinion target accounts will vary a lot.

121
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,870
It can be about one entity,
a particular person, a particular product,

122
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,830
a particular policy, ect.

123
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,020
But it could be about a group of products.

124
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,630
Could be about the products
from a company in general.

125
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,990
Could also be very specific
about one attribute, though.

126
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,090
An attribute of the entity.

127
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,220
For example,
it's just about the battery of iPhone.

128
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,300
It could be someone else's opinion.

129
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,160
And one person might comment on
another person's Opinion, etc.

130
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,690
So, you can see there is a lot of
variation here that will cause

131
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,080
the problem to vary a lot.

132
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,680
Now, opinion content, of course,
can also vary a lot on the surface,

133
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,050
you can identify one-sentence opinion or
one-phrase opinion.

134
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,820
But you can also have longer
text to express an opinion,

135
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,690
like the whole article.

136
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,550
And furthermore we identify
the variation in the sentiment or

137
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,520
emotion damage that's above
the feeding of the opinion holder.

138
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,460
So, we can distinguish a positive
versus negative or mutual or

139
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,420
happy versus sad, separate.

140
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,930
Finally, the opinion
context can also vary.

141
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,760
We can have a simple context, like
different time or different locations.

142
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,360
But there could be also complex contexts,

143
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,840
such as some background
of topic being discussed.

144
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,420
So when opinion is expressed in
particular discourse context, it has to

145
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,970
be interpreted in different ways than
when it's expressed in another context.

146
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:32,230
So the context can be very [INAUDIBLE] to
entire discourse context of the opinion.

147
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,170
From computational perspective,

148
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,150
we're mostly interested in what opinions
can be extracted from text data.

149
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,690
So, it turns out that we can
also differentiate, distinguish,

150
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,810
different kinds of opinions in text
data from computation perspective.

151
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,440
First, the observer might make
a comment about opinion targeting,

152
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,250
observe the word So
in case we have the author's opinion.

153
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,830
For example,
I don't like this phone at all.

154
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,370
And that's an opinion of this author.

155
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:07,940
In contrast, the text might also
report opinions about others.

156
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,940
So the person could also Make observation
about another person's opinion and

157
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,310
reported this opinion.

158
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,740
So for example,
I believe he loves the painting.

159
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:28,410
And that opinion is really about the It is
really expressed by another person here.

160
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,250
So, it doesn't mean this
author loves that painting.

161
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,970
So clearly, the two kinds of opinions
need to be analyzed in different ways,

162
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,430
and sometimes in product reviews,

163
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:45,220
you can see, although mostly the opinions
are false from this reviewer.

164
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,010
Sometimes, a reviewer might mention
opinions of his friend or her friend.

165
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,240
Another complication is that
there may be indirect opinions or

166
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,960
inferred opinions that can be obtained.

167
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,500
By making inferences on

168
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,520
what's expressed in the text that might
not necessarily look like opinion.

169
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,190
For example, one statement that might be,

170
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,260
this phone ran out of
battery in just one hour.

171
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:23,250
Now, this is in a way a factual statement
because It's either true or false, right?

172
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,120
You can even verify that,
but from this statement,

173
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,980
one can also infer some negative opinions
about the quality of the battery of

174
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,160
this phone, or the feeling of
the opinion holder about the battery.

175
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,520
The opinion holder clearly wished
that the battery do last longer.

176
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,460
So these are interesting variations
that we need to pay attention to when we

177
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,880
extract opinions.

178
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,180
Also, for
this reason about indirect opinions,

179
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,300
it's often also very useful to extract
whatever the person has said about

180
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,550
the product, and sometimes factual
sentences like these are also very useful.

181
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,320
So, from a practical viewpoint,

182
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,090
sometimes we don't necessarily
extract the subject of sentences.

183
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:15,240
Instead, again, all the sentences that
are about the opinions are useful for

184
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,420
understanding the person or
understanding the product that we commend.

185
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,530
So the task of opinion mining can be
defined as taking textualized input

186
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,500
to generate a set of
opinion representations.

187
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,010
Each representation we should
identify opinion holder,

188
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,750
target, content, and the context.

189
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,070
Ideally we can also infer opinion
sentiment from the comment and

190
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,260
the context to better understand.

191
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,690
The opinion.

192
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,270
Now often, some elements of
the representation are already known.

193
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:52,140
I just gave a good example in
the case of product we'd use

194
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,780
where the opinion holder and the opinion
target are often expressly identified.

195
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:05,120
And that's not why this turns out to be
one of the simplest opinion mining tasks.

196
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,920
Now, it's interesting to think about
the other tasks that might be also simple.

197
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,880
Because those are the cases
where you can easily build

198
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,791
applications by using
opinion mining techniques.

199
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:23,810
So now that we have talked about what is
opinion mining, we have defined the task.

200
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,260
Let's also just talk a little bit about
why opinion mining is very important and

201
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,130
why it's very useful.

202
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,790
So here, I identify three major reasons,
three broad reasons.

203
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,290
The first is it can help decision support.

204
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,912
It can help us optimize our decisions.

205
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:47,180
We often look at other people's opinions,
look at read the reviews

206
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,100
in order to make a decisions like
buying a product or using a service.

207
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,770
We also would be interested
in others opinions

208
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,330
when we decide whom to vote for example.

209
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:02,030
And policy makers,

210
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,130
may also want to know people's
opinions when designing a new policy.

211
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,460
So that's one general,
kind of, applications.

212
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,540
And it's very broad, of course.

213
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,830
The second application is to understand
people, and this is also very important.

214
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,200
For example, it could help
understand people's preferences.

215
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,460
And this could help us
better serve people.

216
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,010
For example, we optimize a product search
engine or optimize a recommender system

217
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:34,290
if we know what people are interested in,
what people think about product.

218
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,870
It can also help with advertising,
of course, and we can have targeted

219
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:47,170
advertising if we know what kind of
people tend to like what kind of plot.

220
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,800
Now the third kind of application
can be called voluntary survey.

221
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,360
Now this is most important research
that used to be done by doing surveys,

222
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,248
doing manual surveys.

223
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:03,670
Question, answer it.

224
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,680
People need to feel informs
to answer their questions.

225
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,610
Now this is directly related to humans
as sensors, and we can usually aggregate

226
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,680
opinions from a lot of humans through
kind of assess the general opinion.

227
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,490
Now this would be very useful for
business intelligence where manufacturers

228
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,890
want to know where their products
have advantages over others.

229
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,700
What are the winning
features of their products,

230
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,650
winning features of competitive products.

231
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,590
Market research has to do with
understanding consumers oppinions.

232
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,535
And this create very useful directive for
that.

233
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:48,840
Data-driven social science research
can benefit from this because they can

234
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,290
do text mining to understand
the people's opinions.

235
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,990
And if you can aggregate a lot of opinions
from social media, from a lot of, popular

236
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:04,540
information then you can actually
do some study of some questions.

237
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:12,310
For example, we can study the behavior of
people on social media on social networks.

238
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:17,890
And these can be regarded as voluntary
survey done by those people.

239
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,130
In general, we can gain a lot of advantage
in any prediction task because we can

240
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:29,350
leverage the text data as
extra data above any problem.

241
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,371
And so we can use text based
prediction techniques to help you

242
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:39,203
make predictions or
improve the accuracy of prediction.

243
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:49,203
