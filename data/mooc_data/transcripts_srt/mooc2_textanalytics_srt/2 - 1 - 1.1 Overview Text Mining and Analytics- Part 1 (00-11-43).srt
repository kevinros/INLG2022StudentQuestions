[SOUND]
In

2
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:11,700
this lecture we give an overview
of Text Mining and Analytics.

3
00:00:13,743 --> 00:00:19,830
First, let's define the term text mining,
and the term text analytics.

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,200
The title of this course is
called Text Mining and Analytics.

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,250
But the two terms text mining, and text
analytics are actually roughly the same.

6
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,370
So we are not really going to
really distinguish them, and

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,230
we're going to use them interchangeably.

8
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,880
But the reason that we have chosen to use

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,720
both terms in the title is because
there is also some subtle difference,

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,070
if you look at the two phrases literally.

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,640
Mining emphasizes more on the process.

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,683
So it gives us a error rate
medical view of the problem.

13
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:06,359
Analytics, on the other hand
emphasizes more on the result,

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,900
or having a problem in mind.

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,720
We are going to look at text
data to help us solve a problem.

16
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,940
But again as I said, we can treat
these two terms roughly the same.

17
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,820
And I think in the literature
you probably will find the same.

18
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
So we're not going to really
distinguish that in the course.

19
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,450
Both text mining and
text analytics mean that we

20
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,250
want to turn text data into high quality
information, or actionable knowledge.

21
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,020
So in both cases, we

22
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,670
have the problem of dealing with
a lot of text data and we hope to.

23
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,090
Turn these text data into something more
useful to us than the raw text data.

24
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,380
And here we distinguish
two different results.

25
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,530
One is high-quality information,
the other is actionable knowledge.

26
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,680
Sometimes the boundary between
the two is not so clear.

27
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,690
But I also want to say a little bit about

28
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,590
these two different angles of
the result of text field mining.

29
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,982
In the case of high quality information,
we refer to more

30
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:27,715
concise information about the topic.

31
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:34,205
Which might be much easier for
humans to digest than the raw text data.

32
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,045
For example, you might face
a lot of reviews of a product.

33
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,700
A more concise form of information
would be a very concise summary

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,570
of the major opinions about
the features of the product.

35
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,874
Positive about,
let's say battery life of a laptop.

36
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:58,260
Now this kind of results are very useful
to help people digest the text data.

37
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:05,030
And so this is to minimize a human effort
in consuming text data in some sense.

38
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,880
The other kind of output
is actually more knowledge.

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,300
Here we emphasize the utility
of the information or

40
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,190
knowledge we discover from text data.

41
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,830
It's actionable knowledge for some
decision problem, or some actions to take.

42
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:31,510
For example, we might be able to determine
which product is more appealing to us,

43
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,270
or a better choice for
a shocking decision.

44
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:43,190
Now, such an outcome could be
called actionable knowledge,

45
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:49,550
because a consumer can take the knowledge
and make a decision, and act on it.

46
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:55,131
So, in this case text mining supplies
knowledge for optimal decision making.

47
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:59,424
But again, the two are not so
clearly distinguished, so

48
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:03,281
we don't necessarily have
to make a distinction.

49
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:09,821
Text mining is also
related to text retrieval,

50
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:14,380
which is a essential component
in many text mining systems.

51
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,434
Now, text retrieval refers to
finding relevant information from

52
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,380
a large amount of text data.

53
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:30,210
So I've taught another separate book
on text retrieval and search engines.

54
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,680
Where we discussed various techniques for
text retrieval.

55
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,080
If you have taken that book,
and you will find some overlap.

56
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,700
And it will be useful To know
the background of text retrieval

57
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,010
of understanding some of
the topics in text mining.

58
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,350
But, if you have not taken that book,

59
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,440
it's also fine because in this book
on text mining and analytics, we're

60
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,260
going to repeat some of the key concepts
that are relevant for text mining.

61
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,540
But they're at the high level and

62
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,710
they also explain the relation between
text retrieval and text mining.

63
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,278
Text retrieval is very useful for
text mining in two ways.

64
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:23,200
First, text retrieval can be
a preprocessor for text mining.

65
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,600
Meaning that it can help
us turn big text data into

66
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,030
a relatively small amount
of most relevant text data.

67
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,180
Which is often what's needed for
solving a particular problem.

68
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,186
And in this sense, text retrieval
also helps minimize human effort.

69
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:46,365
Text retrieval is also needed for
knowledge provenance.

70
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:50,976
And this roughly corresponds
to the interpretation of text

71
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:56,350
mining as turning text data
into actionable knowledge.

72
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,970
Once we find the patterns in text data, or

73
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,040
actionable knowledge, we generally
would have to verify the knowledge.

74
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,580
By looking at the original text data.

75
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,110
So the users would have to have some text
retrieval support, go back to the original

76
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,010
text data to interpret the pattern or
to better understand an analogy or

77
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,910
to verify whether a pattern
is really reliable.

78
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,830
So this is a high level introduction
to the concept of text mining,

79
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,530
and the relationship between
text mining and retrieval.

80
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,554
Next, let's talk about text
data as a special kind of data.

81
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:45,607
Now it's interesting to
view text data as data

82
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:51,380
generated by humans as subjective sensors.

83
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:03,420
So, this slide shows an analogy
between text data and non-text data.

84
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,832
And between humans as
subjective sensors and

85
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:13,993
physical sensors,
such as a network sensor or a thermometer.

86
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:21,377
So in general a sensor would
monitor the real world in some way.

87
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:26,483
It would sense some signal
from the real world, and

88
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:32,205
then would report the signal as data,
in various forms.

89
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:38,346
For example, a thermometer would watch
the temperature of real world and

90
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:43,310
then we report the temperature
being a particular format.

91
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:49,098
Similarly, a geo sensor would sense
the location and then report.

92
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:53,740
The location specification, for

93
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,140
example, in the form of longitude
value and latitude value.

94
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,580
A network sends over
the monitor network traffic,

95
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,873
or activities in the network and
are reported.

96
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:09,477
Some digital format of data.

97
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:16,460
Similarly we can think of
humans as subjective sensors.

98
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,050
That will observe the real world and
from some perspective.

99
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,440
And then humans will express what they
have observed in the form of text data.

100
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,330
So, in this sense, human is actually
a subjective sensor that would also

101
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,200
sense what's happening in the world and

102
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:43,060
then express what's observed in the form
of data, in this case, text data.

103
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,350
Now, looking at the text data in
this way has an advantage of being

104
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,240
able to integrate all
types of data together.

105
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,381
And that's indeed needed in
most data mining problems.

106
00:08:56,123 --> 00:09:01,672
So here we are looking at
the general problem of data mining.

107
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:07,518
And in general we would Be
dealing with a lot of data

108
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:11,982
about our world that
are related to a problem.

109
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:17,180
And in general it will be dealing with
both non-text data and text data.

110
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,348
And of course the non-text data
are usually produced by physical senses.

111
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:26,330
And those non-text data can
be also of different formats.

112
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,830
Numerical data, categorical,
or relational data,

113
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,800
or multi-media data like video or speech.

114
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,900
So, these non text data are often
very important in some problems.

115
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,590
But text data is also very important,

116
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:50,960
mostly because they contain
a lot of symmetrical content.

117
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,930
And they often contain
knowledge about the users,

118
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,860
especially preferences and
opinions of users.

119
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,990
So, but by treating text data as
the data observed from human sensors,

120
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:14,510
we can treat all this data
together in the same framework.

121
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,110
So the data mining problem is
basically to turn such data,

122
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,960
turn all the data in your actionable
knowledge to that we can take advantage

123
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,260
of it to change the real
world of course for better.

124
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,490
So this means the data mining problem is

125
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:37,450
basically taking a lot of data as input
and giving actionable knowledge as output.

126
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:42,260
Inside of the data mining module,
you can also see

127
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,510
we have a number of different
kind of mining algorithms.

128
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,940
And this is because, for
different kinds of data,

129
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,180
we generally need different algorithms for
mining the data.

130
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,100
For example,

131
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,870
video data might require computer
vision to understand video content.

132
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,050
And that would facilitate
the more effective mining.

133
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,110
And we also have a lot of general
algorithms that are applicable

134
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,948
to all kinds of data and those algorithms,
of course, are very useful.

135
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:19,692
Although, for a particular kind of data,

136
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:23,287
we generally want to also
develop a special algorithm.

137
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:27,939
So this course will cover
specialized algorithms that

138
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:31,994
are particularly useful for
mining text data.

139
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:41,994
