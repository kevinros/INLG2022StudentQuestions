00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,427
[SOUND]
This

2
00:00:07,427 --> 00:00:10,460
lecture is the first one
about the text clustering.

3
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:17,400
In this lecture, we are going to
talk about the text clustering.

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:24,590
This is a very important technique for
doing topic mining and analysis.

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,100
In particular,

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,430
in this lecture we're going to start with
some basic questions about the clustering.

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,040
And that is, what is text clustering and
why we are interested in text clustering.

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,610
In the following lectures, we are going
to talk about how to do text clustering.

9
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,550
How to evaluate the clustering results?

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,400
So what is text clustering?

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,640
Well, clustering actually is
a very general technique for

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,670
data mining as you might have
learned in some other courses.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,250
The idea is to discover natural
structures in the data.

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,040
In another words,
we want to group similar objects together.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,170
In our case, these objects are of course,
text objects.

16
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,510
For example, they can be documents,
terms, passages,

17
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,510
sentences, or websites, and then I'll
go group similar text objects together.

18
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,560
So let's see an example, well, here
you don't really see text objects, but

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,560
I just used some shapes to denote
objects that can be grouped together.

20
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,690
Now if I ask you, what are some natural
structures or natural groups where you,

21
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:47,790
if you look at it and you might agree that
we can group these objects based on chips,

22
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,740
or their locations on this
two dimensional space.

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,110
So we got the three clusters in this case.

24
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,360
And they may not be so
much this agreement about

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,220
these three clusters but it really depends
on the perspective to look at the objects.

26
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,450
Maybe some of you have also seen
thing in a different way, so

27
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,050
we might get different clusters.

28
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:21,400
And you'll see another example
about this ambiguity more clearly.

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,440
But the main point of here is, the problem
is actually not so well defined.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,130
And the problem lies in
how to define similarity.

31
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,220
And what do you mean by similar objects?

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,990
Now this problem has to be

33
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,537
clearly defined in order to have
a well defined clustering problem.

34
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:49,295
And the problem is in general

35
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:53,445
that any two objects can be similar
depending on how you look at them.

36
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:59,119
So for example, this will kept
the two words like car and horse.

37
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,650
So are the two words similar?

38
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,490
Well, it depends on how if
we look at the physical

39
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,000
properties of car and
horse they are very different but

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,630
if you look at them functionally,
a car and a horse,

41
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,650
can both be transportation tools.

42
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,220
So in that sense, they may be similar.

43
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,599
So as we can see, it really depends on
our perspective, to look at the objects.

44
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,700
And so it ought to make
the clustering problem well defined.

45
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,050
A user must define the perspective for
assessing similarity.

46
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,599
And we call this perspective
the clustering bias.

47
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:54,180
And when you define a clustering problem,
it's important to specify

48
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,870
your perspective for
similarity or for defining

49
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,830
the similarity that will be
used to group similar objects.

50
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:11,795
because otherwise,
the similarity is not well defined and

51
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:16,870
one can have different
ways to group objects.

52
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,910
So let's look at the example here.

53
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,210
You are seeing some objects,
or some shapes,

54
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,730
that are very similar to what you
have seen on the first slide, but

55
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,430
if I ask you to group these objects,
again, you might

56
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,052
feel there is more than here
than on the previous slide.

57
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:47,810
For example, you might think, well, we

58
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,510
can steer a group by ships, so that would
give us cluster that looks like this.

59
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,558
However, you might also feel that,

60
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:02,380
well, maybe the objects can be
grouped based on their sizes.

61
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,020
So that would give us a different way
to cluster the data if we look at

62
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,890
the size and
look at the similarity in size.

63
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,440
So as you can see clearly here,
depending on the perspective,

64
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,860
we'll get different clustering result.

65
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,750
So that also clearly tells us that in
order to evaluate the clustering without,

66
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,060
we must use perspective.

67
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,054
Without perspective, it's very hard to
define what is the best clustering result.

68
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:40,970
So there are many examples
of text clustering setup.

69
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,380
And so for example, we can cluster
documents in the whole text collection.

70
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,269
So in this case,
documents are the units to be clustered.

71
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,780
We may be able to cluster terms.

72
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,300
In this case, terms are objects.

73
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,480
And a cluster of terms can be used to
define concept, or theme, or a topic.

74
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,530
In fact, there's a topic models that you
have seen some previous lectures can

75
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,850
give you cluster of terms in some
sense if you take terms with

76
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:19,610
high probabilities from word distribution.

77
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:25,330
Another example is just to cluster any
text segments, for example, passages,

78
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,970
sentences, or any segments that you can
extract the former larger text objects.

79
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,300
For example, we might extract the order
text segments about the topic,

80
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,030
let's say, by using a topic model.

81
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,620
Now once we've got those
text objects then we can

82
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,850
cluster the segments that we've got to

83
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,908
discover interesting clusters that
might also ripple in the subtopics.

84
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:00,860
So this is a case of combining text
clustering with some other techniques.

85
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,762
And in general you will
see a lot of text mining

86
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,670
can be accurate combined in
a flexible way to achieve

87
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,840
the goal of doing more sophisticated
mining and analysis of text data.

88
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,070
We can also cluster fairly
large text objects and by that,

89
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,600
I just mean text objects may
contain a lot of documents.

90
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,440
So for example, we might cluster websites.

91
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,228
Each website is actually
compose of multiple documents.

92
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:39,065
Similarly, we can also cluster articles
written by the same author, for example.

93
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:44,573
So we can trigger all the articles
published by also as one unit for

94
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:45,785
clustering.

95
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:50,652
In this way, we might group authors
together based on whether they're

96
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:52,770
published papers or similar.

97
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,290
For the more text clusters will be for
the cluster to generate a hierarchy.

98
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:06,330
That's because we can in general cluster
any text object at different levels.

99
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,750
So more generally why is
text clustering interesting?

100
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,100
Well, it's because it's a very
useful technique for text mining,

101
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,710
particularly exploratory text analysis.

102
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,690
And so a typical scenario is that
you were getting a lot of text data,

103
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,300
let's say all the email messages
from customers in some time period,

104
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,070
all the literature articles, etc.

105
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,960
And then you hope to get a sense
about what are the overall content of

106
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,970
the connection, so for example,
you might be interested in getting

107
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,910
a sense about major topics,
or what are some typical or

108
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,360
representative documents
in the connection.

109
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,164
And clustering to help
us achieve this goal.

110
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:59,949
We sometimes also want to link
a similar text objects together.

111
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:03,960
And these objects might be
duplicated content, for example.

112
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,830
And in that case,

113
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,560
such a technique can help us remove
redundancy and remove duplicate documents.

114
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,280
Sometimes they are about
the same topic and

115
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,140
by linking them together we can have
more complete coverage of a topic.

116
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,420
We may also used text clustering to create
a structure on the text data and sometimes

117
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,840
we can create a hierarchy of structures
and this is very useful for problems.

118
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,140
We may also use text clustering to induce
additional features to represent text

119
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,206
data when we cluster documents together,
we can treat each cluster as a feature.

120
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:44,100
And then we can say when
a document is in this cluster and

121
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,790
then the feature value would be one.

122
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,870
And if a document is not in this cluster,
then the feature value is zero.

123
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,298
And this helps provide additional
discrimination that might be used for

124
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:57,900
text classification as
we will discuss later.

125
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,320
So there are, in general,
many applications of text clustering.

126
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,218
And I just thought of
two very specific ones.

127
00:10:06,218 --> 00:10:08,490
One is to cluster search results, for

128
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,360
example, [INAUDIBLE] search engine
can cluster such results so

129
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,020
that the user can see overall structure
of the results of return the fall query.

130
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,454
And when the query's ambiguous this
is particularly useful because

131
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:26,710
the clusters likely represent
different senses of ambiguous word.

132
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,535
Another application is to understand the
major complaints from customers based on

133
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:34,943
their emails, right.

134
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:40,238
So in this case,
we can cluster email messages and

135
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:44,903
then find in the major
clusters from there,

136
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:51,355
we can understand what are the major
complaints about them.

137
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:57,897
