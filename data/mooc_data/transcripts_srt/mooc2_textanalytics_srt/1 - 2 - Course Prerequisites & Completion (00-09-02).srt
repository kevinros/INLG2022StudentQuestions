00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:07,641
[SOUND]
This

2
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,030
lecture is a brief
introduction to the course.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,607
We're going to cover the objectives
of the course, the prerequisites and

4
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:22,093
course formats, reference books and
how to complete the course.

5
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:25,598
The objectives of the course
are the following.

6
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:29,555
First, we would like to
cover the basic context and

7
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:32,970
practical techniques of text data mining.

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:40,234
So this means we will not be able to
cover some advanced techniques in detail,

9
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:44,258
but whether we choose
the practical use for

10
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:48,196
techniques and then treat them in order.

11
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:53,055
We're going to also cover the basic
concepts that are very useful for

12
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:54,579
many applications.

13
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,814
The second objective is to cover
more general techniques for

14
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:05,047
text or data mining, so
we emphasize the coverage of general

15
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:12,050
techniques that can be applicable to
any text in any natural language.

16
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,424
We also hope that these
techniques to either

17
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:22,334
automatically work on problems
without any human effort or

18
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:26,246
only requiring minimum human effort.

19
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:30,800
So these criteria have
helped others to choose

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,787
techniques that can be
applied to many applications.

21
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:42,497
This is in contrast to some more
detailed analysis of text data,

22
00:01:42,497 --> 00:01:46,317
particularly using natural
language processing techniques.

23
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:49,768
Now such techniques
are also very important.

24
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:54,940
And they are indeed, necessary for
some of the applications,

25
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:01,610
where we would like to go in-depth to
understand text, they are in more detail.

26
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,220
Such detail in understanding techniques,
however,

27
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,360
are generally not scalable and they
tend to require a lot of human effort.

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,160
So they cannot be easy
to apply to any domain.

29
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,188
So as you can imagine in practice,

30
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:23,253
it would be beneficial to combine
both kinds of techniques using

31
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:29,161
the general techniques that we'll be
covering in this course as a basis and

32
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:35,757
improve these techniques by using more
human effort whenever it's appropriate.

33
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:42,397
We also would like to provide a hands-on
experience to you in multiple aspects.

34
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:48,049
First, you'll do some experiments
using a text mining toolkit and

35
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:51,430
implementing text mining algorithms.

36
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,037
Second, you will have opportunity to
experiment with some algorithms for

37
00:02:57,037 --> 00:03:01,309
text mining and
analytics to try them on some datasets and

38
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:04,159
to understand how to do experiments.

39
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,300
And finally, you have opportunity
to participate in a competition

40
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,808
of text-based prediction task.

41
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:15,826
You're expected to know the basic
concepts of computer science.

42
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:19,701
For example, the data structures and

43
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:25,403
some other really basic
concepts in computer science.

44
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:29,277
You are also expected to be
familiar with programming and

45
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:33,450
comfortable with programming,
particularly with C++.

46
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,093
This course,
however is not about programming.

47
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:39,533
So you are not expected to
do a lot of coding, but

48
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:44,532
we're going to give you C++ toolkit
that's fairly sophisticated.

49
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:49,392
So you have to be comfortable
with handling such a toolkit and

50
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:53,217
you may be asked to write
a small amount of code.

51
00:03:56,617 --> 00:04:00,753
It's also useful if you
know some concepts and

52
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:07,130
techniques in probability and
statistics, but it's not necessary.

53
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,550
Knowing such knowledge would help you
understand some of the algorithm in

54
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,220
more depth.

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:23,870
The format of the course is lectures
plus quizzes that will be given to you

56
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:31,879
in the regular basis and there is
also optional programming assignment.

57
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,380
Now, we've made programming
assignments optional.

58
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,053
Not because it's not important, but

59
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:46,019
because we suspect that the not
all of you will have the need for

60
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:51,087
computing resources to do
the program assignment.

61
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:55,948
So naturally,
we would encourage all of you to try to do

62
00:04:55,948 --> 00:05:01,657
the program assignments,
if possible as that will be a great way

63
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:06,860
to learn about the knowledge
that we teach in this course.

64
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,948
There's no required reading for
this course,

65
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:15,660
but I was list some of
the useful reference books here.

66
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,680
So we expect you to be able to understand
all the essential materials by just

67
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,810
watching the actual videos and
you should be able to answer all the quiz

68
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,540
questions by just watching the videos.

69
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,400
But it's always good to read additional
books in the larger scope of knowledge,

70
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,260
so here is this the four books.

71
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,795
The first is a textbook about
statistical language processing.

72
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:52,599
Some of the chapters [INAUDIBLE]
are especially relevant to this course.

73
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:57,258
The second one is a textbook
about information retrieval,

74
00:05:57,258 --> 00:06:01,449
but it has broadly covered
a number of techniques that

75
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:05,752
are really in the category
of text mining techniques.

76
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:10,460
So it's also useful, because of that.

77
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,020
The third book is actually
a collection of silly articles and

78
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,290
it has broadly covered all
the aspects of mining text data.

79
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,048
The mostly relevant chapters
are also listed here.

80
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:31,474
In these chapters, you can find
some in depth discussion of cutting

81
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:36,439
edge research on the topics that
we discussed in this course.

82
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,993
And the last one is actually
a book that Sean Massung and

83
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:45,745
I are currently writing and
we're going to make the rough

84
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:51,370
draft chapters available at
this URL listed right here.

85
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,220
You can also find additional
reference books and

86
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,170
other readings at the URL
listed at the bottom.

87
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,491
So finally, some information about how

88
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:07,218
to complete the course this
information is also on the web.

89
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,755
So I just briefly go over it and

90
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:15,552
you can complete the course by
earning one of the following badges.

91
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:18,014
One is Course Achievement Badge.

92
00:07:18,014 --> 00:07:23,318
To earn that,
you have to have at least a 70%

93
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:28,357
average score on all the quizzes combined.

94
00:07:28,357 --> 00:07:35,034
It does mean every quiz has to be 70% or
better.

95
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:39,294
The second batch here,
this is a Course Mastery Badge and

96
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:44,912
this just requires a higher score,
90% average score for the quizzes.

97
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:52,190
There are also three
optional programming badges.

98
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,721
I said earlier that we encourage you
to do programming assignments, but

99
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:59,925
they're not necessary,
they're not required.

100
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:02,188
The first is
Programming Achievement Badge.

101
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:05,648
This is similar to the call
switching from the badge.

102
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:12,649
Here would require you to get at least 70%
average score on programming assignments.

103
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:17,696
And similarly, the mastery badge

104
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:22,046
is given to those who can score

105
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:26,928
90% average score or better.

106
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:33,095
The last badge is
a Text Mining Competition Leader Badge and

107
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:39,768
this is given to those of you who
do well in the competition task.

108
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:44,530
And specifically, we're planning to give

109
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,684
the badge to the top
30% in the leaderboard.

110
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:59,684
