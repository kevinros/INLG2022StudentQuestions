[SOUND]

2
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:13,988
So here are some specific examples of what

3
00:00:13,988 --> 00:00:15,926
we can't do today and

4
00:00:15,926 --> 00:00:21,970
part of speech tagging is still
not easy to do 100% correctly.

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,938
So in the example, he turned off the
highway verses he turned off the fan and

6
00:00:27,938 --> 00:00:33,342
the two offs actually have somewhat
a differentness in their active

7
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:39,633
categories and also its very difficult
to get a complete the parsing correct.

8
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:44,450
Again, the example, a man saw a boy
with a telescope can actually

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,400
be very difficult to parse
depending on the context.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,278
Precise deep semantic
analysis is also very hard.

11
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:55,648
For example, to define the meaning of own,

12
00:00:55,648 --> 00:01:01,493
precisely is very difficult in
the sentence, like John owns a restaurant.

13
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:04,737
So the state of the off can
be summarized as follows.

14
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:05,506
Robust and

15
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:11,070
general NLP tends to be shallow while
a deep understanding does not scale up.

16
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,565
For this reason in this course,
the techniques that we cover are in

17
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:23,610
general, shallow techniques for
analyzing text data and

18
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,630
mining text data and they are generally
based on statistical analysis.

19
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,510
So there are robust and
general and they are in

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,550
the in category of shallow analysis.

21
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,320
So such techniques have
the advantage of being able to be

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,099
applied to any text data in
any natural about any topic.

23
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:55,425
But the downside is that, they don't
give use a deeper understanding of text.

24
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:59,159
For that, we have to rely on
deeper natural language analysis.

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,930
That typically would require
a human effort to annotate

26
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,940
a lot of examples of analysis that would
like to do and then computers can use

27
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,120
machine learning techniques and learn from
these training examples to do the task.

28
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,880
So in practical applications, we generally
combine the two kinds of techniques

29
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:29,150
with the general statistical and
methods as a backbone as the basis.

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,010
These can be applied to any text data.

31
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,060
And on top of that, we're going to use
humans to, and you take more data and

32
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,770
to use supervised machine learning
to do some tasks as well as we can,

33
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,640
especially for those important
tasks to bring humans into the loop

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,170
to analyze text data more precisely.

35
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,036
But this course will cover
the general statistical approaches

36
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:04,177
that generally,
don't require much human effort.

37
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:09,386
So they're practically,
more useful that some of the deeper

38
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:16,409
analysis techniques that require a lot of
human effort to annotate the text today.

39
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:21,302
So to summarize,
the main points we take are first NLP

40
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:24,580
is the foundation for text mining.

41
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,465
So obviously, the better we
can understand the text data,

42
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:29,090
the better we can do text mining.

43
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,930
Computers today are far from being able
to understand the natural language.

44
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,030
Deep NLP requires common sense
knowledge and inferences.

45
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,803
Thus, only working for
very limited domains not feasible for

46
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:44,833
large scale text mining.

47
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:50,003
Shallow NLP based on statistical
methods can be done in large scale and

48
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:52,543
is the main topic of this course and

49
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:56,763
they are generally applicable
to a lot of applications.

50
00:03:56,763 --> 00:04:02,081
They are in some sense also,
more useful techniques.

51
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:06,834
In practice,
we use statistical NLP as the basis and

52
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:11,810
we'll have humans for
help as needed in various ways.
