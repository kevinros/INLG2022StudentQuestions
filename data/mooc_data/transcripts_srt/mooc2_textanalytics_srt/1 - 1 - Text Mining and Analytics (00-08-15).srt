[SOUND]

2
00:00:03,183 --> 00:00:07,606
Hello.

3
00:00:07,606 --> 00:00:11,840
Welcome to the course Text Mining and
Analytics.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,940
My name is ChengXiang Zhai.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,110
I have a nickname, Cheng.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,830
I am a professor of the Department of
Computer Science at the University of

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,240
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,740
This course is a part of
a data mining specialization

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,320
offered by the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,770
In addition to this course,
there are four other courses offered by

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,770
Professor Jiawei Han,
Professor John Hart and me, followed by

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,370
a capstone project course that
all of us will teach together.

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:58,207
This course is particularly related to
another course in the specialization,

14
00:00:58,207 --> 00:01:04,900
mainly text retrieval and search engines
in that both courses are about text data.

15
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:12,463
In contrast, pattern discovery and
cluster analysis are about

16
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:18,352
algorithms more applicable to
all kinds of data in general.

17
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:23,110
The visualization course is also
relatively general in that the techniques

18
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,351
can be applied to all kinds of data.

19
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:33,490
This course addresses a pressing need for
harnessing big text data.

20
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:39,651
Text data has been growing
dramatically recently,

21
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:44,582
mostly because of the advance of
technologies deployed on the web

22
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:48,900
that would enable people to
quickly generate text data.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,070
So, I listed some of
the examples on this slide

24
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,710
that can show a variety of text
data that are available today.

25
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,670
For example, if you think about
the data on the internet, on the web,

26
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,450
everyday we are seeing many
web pages being created.

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,040
Blogs are another kind
of new text data that

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,680
are being generated quickly by people.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,040
Anyone can write a blog
article on the web.

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,880
New articles of course have always been

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,090
a main kind of text data that
being generated everyday.

32
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,168
Emails are yet another kind of text data.

33
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:41,290
And literature is also representing
a large portion of text data.

34
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,048
It's also especially very important
because of the high quality

35
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:50,570
in the data.

36
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,760
That is,
we encode our knowledge about the word

37
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:03,350
using text data represented by
all the literature articles.

38
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,630
It's a vast amount of knowledge of

39
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:12,999
all the text and
data in these literature articles.

40
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:21,400
Twitter is another representative
text data representing social media.

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,020
Of course there are forums as well.

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,690
People are generating tweets very quickly

43
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,920
indeed as we are speaking perhaps many
people have already written many tweets.

44
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,990
So, as you can see there
are all kinds of text data

45
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,739
that are being generated very quickly.

46
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,350
Now these text data present
some challenges for people.

47
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,699
It's very hard for anyone to
digest all the text data quickly.

48
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:55,577
In particular, it's impossible for
scientists to read all of the for

49
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:58,970
example or for
anyone to read all the tweets.

50
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,730
So there's a need for tools to help
people digest text data more efficiently.

51
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,400
There is also another
interesting opportunity

52
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,680
provided by such big text data, and
that is it's possible to leverage

53
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,880
the amount of text data to
discover interesting patterns to

54
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,800
turn text data into actionable knowledge
that can be useful for decision making.

55
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,624
So for example,
product managers may be interested

56
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:37,710
in knowing the feedback of
customers about their products,

57
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,198
knowing how well their
products are being received as

58
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:46,520
compared with the products of competitors.

59
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,240
This can be a good opportunity for

60
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,160
leveraging text data as we have seen
a lot of reviews of product on the web.

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,830
So if we can develop a master text
mining techniques to tap into such

62
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:07,210
a [INAUDIBLE] to extract the knowledge and
opinions of people about these products,

63
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,298
then we can help these product managers
to gain business intelligence or

64
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:16,419
to essentially feedback
from their customers.

65
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,400
In scientific research, for example,

66
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,250
scientists are interested in knowing
the trends of research topics, knowing

67
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,710
about what related fields have discovered.

68
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,920
This problem is especially important
in biology research as well.

69
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,280
Different communities tend to
use different terminologies, yet

70
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,960
they're starting very similar problems.

71
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,900
So how can we integrate the knowledge
that is covered in different communities

72
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,360
to help study a particular problem?

73
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,459
It's very important, and
it can speed up scientific discovery.

74
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,100
So there are many such examples
where we can leverage the text data

75
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,680
to discover useable knowledge
to optimize our decision.

76
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,090
The main techniques for

77
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,300
harnessing big text data are text
retrieval and text mining.

78
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,480
So these are two very much
related technologies.Yet,

79
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,800
they have somewhat different purposes.

80
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:29,167
These two kinds of techniques are covered
in the tool in this specialization.

81
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:34,400
So, text retrieval on search
engines covers text retrieval,

82
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,920
and this is necessary to
turn big text data into

83
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,750
a much smaller but more relevant text
data, which are often the data that

84
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,470
we need to handle a particular problem or
to optimize a particular decision.

85
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:57,360
This course covers text mining which
is a second step in this pipeline

86
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,340
that can be used to further process
the small amount of relevant data

87
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,170
to extract the knowledge or to help
people digest the text data easily.

88
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,940
So the two courses are clearly related,
in fact,

89
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,810
some of the techniques are shared by
both text retrieval and text mining.

90
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,790
If you have already taken the text
retrieval course, then you might see

91
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:31,365
some of the content being repeated
in this text mining course, although

92
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:35,200
we'll be talking about the techniques
from a very different perspective.

93
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,820
If you have not taken
the text retrieval course,

94
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,010
it's also fine because this
course is self-contained and

95
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:50,270
you can certainly understand all of
the materials without a problem.

96
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,116
Of course, you might find it
beneficial to take both courses and

97
00:07:55,116 --> 00:08:00,517
that will give you a very complete set
of skills to handle big text data.

98
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:12,758
