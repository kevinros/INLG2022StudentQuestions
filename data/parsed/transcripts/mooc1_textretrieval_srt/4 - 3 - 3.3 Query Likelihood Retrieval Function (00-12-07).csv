4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,1,7.88,11.96,This lecture is about query likelihood and probabilistic retrieval model. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,2,14.04,15.31,_In this lecture, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,3,15.31,19.18,we continue the discussion of probabilistic retrieval model. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,4,19.18,20.409,_In particular, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,5,20.409,25.87,we're going to talk about the query likelihood of the retrieval function. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,6,25.87,31.27,In the query of likelihood retrieval model our idea is a model. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,7,31.27,35.42,_How a likely a user, who likes a document would pose a particular query. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,8,36.98,39.96,_So in this case, you can imagine, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,9,39.96,45.6,if a user likes this particular document about the presidential campaign news. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,10,46.84,51.03,_Then we can assume, the user would use this _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,11,51.03,54.67,working as a basis to oppose a query to try and retrieve this doc. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,12,57.26,64.06,_So you can imagine the user, could use a process that works as follows, where _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,13,64.06,68.63,we assume that the query is generated by sampling words from the document. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,14,70.56,75.31,_So for example, a user might pick a word like _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,15,75.31,79.42,_presidential from this document, and then use this as a query word. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,16,80.6,84.59,_And then the user would pick another word, like campaign and _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,17,84.59,85.9,that would be the second query word. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,18,87.42,88.72,_Now this, of course, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,19,88.72,93.5,_is assumption that we have made about, how a user would post a query. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,20,95.17,98.63,Whether a user actually followed this process. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,21,98.63,99.81,Maybe a different question. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,22,99.81,101.17,_But this assumption, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,23,101.17,105.28999999999999,has allowed us to formally characterize this conditional probability. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,24,106.39,110.86,And this allows to also not rely on the big table that I showed you earlier 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,25,112.58,115.75,to use imperative data to estimate this probability. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,26,116.86,120.82,And this is why we can use this idea to then further derive 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,27,120.82,123.569,retrieval function that we can implement with the languages. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,28,124.9,129.39,_So, as you see, the assumption that we've made here is, each query word, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,29,129.39,132.79,_is independent in this sample, and also, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,30,132.79,137.88,each word is basically obtained from the document. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,31,140.91,144.54,So now let's see how this works exactly. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,32,144.54,148.37,_Well, since we are computing a query likelihood, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,33,149.77,155.05,_then the probability here is just the probability of this particular query, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,34,155.05,157.21,which is a sequence of words. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,35,157.21,162.14,And we make the assumption that each word is generated independently. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,36,162.14,166.61,_So, as a result, the probability of the query is just a product _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,37,166.61,168.92000000000002,of the probability of each query word. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,38,170.09,172.66,_Now, how do we compute the probability of each query word? _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,39,172.66,174.37,_Well, based on the assumption, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,40,174.37,180.44,_that a word is picked from the document, that the user has in mind. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,41,180.44,183.725,_Now we know the probability of each word is just the, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,42,183.725,188.12,the relative frequency of the word in the document. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,43,188.12,193.78,_So, for example the probability of presidential given the document, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,44,193.78,197.47,_would be just the count of presidential in the document, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,45,197.47,200.92000000000002,divided by the total number of words in the document or document length. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,46,203.05,207.76,_So with this these assumptions, we now have actual simple formula for _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,47,207.76,208.94,_retrieval, right? _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,48,208.94,210.91,We can use this to rank our document. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,49,210.91,214.19,So does this model work? 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,50,214.19,218.67000000000002,_Let's take a look, here are some example documents that you have seen before. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,51,218.67000000000002,221.77,Suppose now the query is presidential campaign. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,52,221.77,225.89,And we see the formula here on the top. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,53,225.89,227.49,So how do we score these documents? 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,54,227.49,230.71,_Well it's very simple, right, we just count how many times we have seen _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,55,230.71,234.388,_presidential, how many times we have seen campaign etc. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,56,234.388,237.62,_And see here 44 and we've seen president Jou Tai, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,57,237.62,241.125,so that's two over the lands of document the four. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,58,241.125,246.2,Multiply by 1 over lands of document of 4 for the probability of 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,59,246.2,251.25,campaign and seeming we can probabilities for the other two documents. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,60,253.38,258.56,_Now if you'll look at this, these numbers or these, this, these formulas for _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,61,258.56,265.2,_scoring all these documents, it seems to make sense because, if we assume d3 and _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,62,265.2,269.96,_d4 have about the same length, then it looks like we will rank d4 _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,63,271.25,276.14,_above d3 and which is above d2, right? _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,64,276.14,282.03,_And as we would expect, looks like it did capture the tf heuristic. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,65,282.03,284.71,And so this seems to work well. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,66,286.53,290.10699999999997,_However, if we try a different query like this one, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,67,290.10699999999997,294.35,_presidential campaign update, then we might see a problem. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,68,295.6,296.77,But what problem? 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,69,296.77,302.5,_Well, think about update, now none of these documents has mentioned update. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,70,302.5,307.6,So according to our assumption that a user would pick a order from a document 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,71,307.6,309.42,_to generate a query, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,72,309.42,315.11,then the probability of obtaining a word like update would be what. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,73,315.11,316.07,_Would be zero, right? _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,74,317.23,321.38,_So that cause a problem, because it would cause all these documents _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,75,321.38,323.73,to have zero probability of generating this query. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,76,325.33,331.64,_Now, while it's fine to have a zero probability for d2 which is not relevant. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,77,331.64,334.658,It's not okay to have zero for d3 and 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,78,334.658,338.6,_d4, because now we no longer can distinguish them. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,79,338.6,341.89,_What's worse, we can't even distinguish them from d 2. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,80,341.89,345.7,_All right, so that's obviously not desirable. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,81,345.7,350.96,_Now when one has such result, we should think about what has caused this problem. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,82,352.49,355.58,_So we have to examine what assumptions have been made, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,83,356.7,358.67,as we derive this ranking function. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,84,359.83,363.04,Now if you examine those assumptions carefully you would realize. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,85,363.04,366.69,_What has caused this problem, right? _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,86,366.69,371.49,_So, take a moment to think about, what do you think is the reason why _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,87,371.49,374.9,_update has zero probability, and how do we fix it? _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,88,377.65,378.24,Right? 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,89,378.24,381.42,_So, if you think about this for the moment that you realize that. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,90,381.42,383.88,That's because we have made an assumption 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,91,383.88,389.22,that every query word must be drawn from the document in the user's mind. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,92,389.22,392.01,_So, in order to fix this, we have to assume that, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,93,392.01,396.35,_the user could have drawn a word, not necessarily from the document. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,94,396.35,398.93,So let's see improved model. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,95,398.93,400.72,_An improvement here is to say that, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,96,400.72,405.3,_well, instead of drawing a word from the document, let's imagine that the user _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,97,405.3,410.26,would actually draw a word from a document model and so I show a model here. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,98,410.26,413.24,_Here we assume that this document is generated, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,99,413.24,415.92,by using this unigram image model. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,100,415.92,421.56,_Now, this model, doesn't necessarily assign zero probability for update. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,101,421.56,425.46,In fact we assume this model does not assign zero probability for any word. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,102,425.46,428.94,Now if we're thinking this way then the generation 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,103,428.94,430.7,process is a little bit different. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,104,430.7,434.98,_Now the user has this model in mind, instead of this particular document. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,105,434.98,437.4,Although the model has to be estimated based on the document. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,106,437.4,442.92,So the user can again generate the query using a similar process. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,107,442.92,447.68,_They may pick a word, for example presidential and another word campaign. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,108,449.01,452.39,_Now the difference is that, this time we can also pick a word like update, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,109,452.39,454.95,even though update it doesn't occur in the document 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,110,454.95,458.04,to potentially generate a query word like update. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,111,458.04,463.83,_So that, a query was updated we want to have zero probabilities. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,112,463.83,466.79,_So this would fix our problem and it's also reasonable, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,113,466.79,471.26,_because we're now thinking of what the user is looking for in a more general way, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,114,471.26,475.15999999999997,that is unique language model instead of a fixed document. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,115,475.15999999999997,476.7,_So how do we compute this query, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,116,476.7,481.0,_like if we make this sum where it involves two steps, right? _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,117,481.0,486.137,_The first is the computer's model, and we call it talking the language model here. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,118,487.39,492.31,_For example, I have shown two possible energy models here. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,119,492.31,495.06,This has been based on two documents. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,120,495.06,497.16,And then given a query and I get a mining algorithms. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,121,497.16,502.7,_The second step, is just to compute the likelihood of this query. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,122,502.7,507.21,_And by making independence assumptions, we could then have this probability as _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,123,507.21,509.7,_a product of the probability of each query word, all right? _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,124,510.9,512.37,But we do this for both documents. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,125,512.37,515.71,And then we're going to score these two documents and then rank them. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,126,517.16,521.31,So that's the basic idea of this query likelihood retrieval function. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,127,521.31,528.05,So more generally than this ranking function would look like the following and 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,128,528.05,533.917,_here as, we assume that query has end words W1 through WN. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,129,533.917,541.13,_And then the scoring function, the ranking function is the probability _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,130,541.13,546.08,_that we observe this query, given that the user is thinking of this document. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,131,546.08,551.97,And this assumed to be product of probabilities of all individual words and 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,132,551.97,553.819,this is based on the independence assumption. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,133,555.56,559.26,_Now we actually often score the, document for _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,134,559.26,565.24,_this query by using log of the query likelihood, as shown on the sigma line. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,135,566.71,572.56,Now we do this to avoid having a lot of small probabilities. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,136,574.28,575.83,_M, multiplied together. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,137,575.83,578.19,And this could cause underflow and 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,138,578.19,584.1,we might lose precision by transforming the value as a logarithm function. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,139,584.1,590.43,_We maintain the order of these documents, yet we can avoid the end of flow problem. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,140,592.86,597.051,So if we take longer than transformation of coarse the product that would become 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,141,597.051,599.92,_a sum, as you stake in the line here. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,142,599.92,603.62,_So it's a sum of all of the query words, and inside the sum _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,143,603.62,607.67,that is log of the probability of this word given by the document. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,144,609.36,613.17,_And then we can further rewrite the sum, into a different form. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,145,614.31,619.95,_So in the first of the sum here, in this sum, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,146,621.91,625.12,we have it over all the query words n query words. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,147,628.79,633.18,_And in this sum, we have a sum of all the possible words but _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,148,633.18,637.05,we put a counter here of each word in the query. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,149,637.05,639.78,_Essentially we are only considering the words in the query, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,150,639.78,643.52,_because if a word is not in the query, it can would be zero. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,151,643.52,646.77,So we're still considering only these end words. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,152,646.77,650.9,_But we're using a different form as if we were going to a sum of all the words, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,153,650.9,651.57,in the vocabulary. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,154,652.96,656.435,And of course a word might occur multiple times in the query. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,155,656.435,658.375,_That's wh, why we have a count here. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,156,661.08,663.555,And then this part is 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,157,663.555,666.865,log of the probability of the word given by the document MG model. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,158,668.617,671.527,_So you can see, in this material function, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,159,671.527,673.547,we actually know the count of the word in the query. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,160,673.547,676.467,_So, the only thing that we don't know is this document language model. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,161,677.817,681.31,_Therefore, we can convert through the retrieval problem _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,162,681.31,684.504,into the problem of estimating this document language model. 
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,163,684.504,690.34,_So that we can compute, the probability of each query we're given by this document. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,164,692.25,696.61,_At different estimation methods here, would lead to different ranking functions. _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,165,696.61,700.43,_And this is just like a different a ways to place a doc in the vector, _
4 - 3 - 3.3 Query Likelihood Retrieval Function (00-12-07).srt,166,700.43,702.03,in the vector space.
