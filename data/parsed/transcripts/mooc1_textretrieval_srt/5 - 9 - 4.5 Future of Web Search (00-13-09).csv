5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,2,7.043,10.08,This lecture is about the future of web search. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,3,12.66,17.56,_In this lecture, we're going to talk about some possible future trends _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,4,17.56,22.489,of web search and intelligent information retrieval systems in general. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,5,24.37,28.561,_In order to further improve the accuracy of a search engine, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,6,28.561,33.752,it's important that to consider special cases of information need. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,7,33.752,39.056,So one particular trend could be to have more and more specialized than 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,8,39.056,44.63,_customized search engines, and they can be called vertical search engines. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,9,46.26,50.18,These vertical search engines can be expected to be more effective than 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,10,50.18,55.94,the current general search engines because they could assume that 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,11,55.94,62.07,_users are a special group of users that might have a common information need, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,12,62.07,66.42,_and then the search engine can be customized with this ser, so, such users. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,13,67.97,72.15,_And because of the customization, it's also possible to do personalization. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,14,72.15,74.36,_So the search can be personalized, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,15,75.43,78.19,because we have a better understanding of the users. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,16,80.33,85.55,_Because of the restrictions with domain, we also have some advantages _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,17,85.55,89.59,_in handling the documents, because we can have better understanding of documents. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,18,89.59,93.88,_For example, particular words may not be ambiguous in such a domain. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,19,93.88,96.75,So we can bypass the problem of ambiguity. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,20,98.39,101.46000000000001,_Another trend we can expect to see, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,21,101.46000000000001,105.6,is the search engine will be able to learn over time. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,22,105.6,112.43,_It's like a lifetime learning or lifelong learning, and this is, of course, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,23,112.43,117.8,very attractive because that means the search engine will self-improve itself. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,24,117.8,121.78,_As more people are using it, the search engine will become better and better, and _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,25,121.78,123.26,_this is already happening, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,26,123.26,126.98,because the search engines can learn from the [INAUDIBLE] of feedback. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,27,126.98,130.8,_More users use it, and the quality of the search engine allows for _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,28,130.8,135.84,_the popular queries that are typed in by many users allow it to become better, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,29,135.84,139.11,so this is sort of another feature that we will see. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,30,141.26,144.6,The third trend might be to the integration of 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,31,144.6,147.19,bottles of information access. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,32,147.19,152.05,_So search, navigation, and recommendation or filtering might be _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,33,152.05,157.48,combined to form a full-fledged information management system. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,34,157.48,162.47,_And in the beginning of this course, we talked about push versus pull. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,35,162.47,167.1,_These are different modes of information access, but these modes can be combined. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,36,168.17000000000002,173.66,_And similarly, in the pull mode, querying and the browsing could also be combined. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,37,173.66,178.39,_And in fact we're doing that basically, today, is the [INAUDIBLE] search endings. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,38,178.39,182.0,_We are querying, sometimes browsing, clicking on links. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,39,182.0,185.12,Sometimes we've got some information recommended. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,40,185.12,191.466,Although most of the cases the information recommended is because of advertising. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,41,191.466,196.305,_But in the future, you can imagine seamlessly integrate the system with _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,42,196.305,201.38,_multi-mode for information access, and that would be convenient for people. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,43,203.16,207.16,Another trend is that we might see systems 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,44,207.16,210.97,that try to go beyond the searches to support the user tasks. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,45,210.97,216.73,_After all, the reason why people want to search is to solve a problem or _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,46,216.73,219.69,to make a decision or perform a task. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,47,219.69,222.38,For example consumers might search for 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,48,222.38,225.385,_opinions about products in order to purchase a product, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,49,225.385,230.16,_choose a good product by, so in this case it would be beneficial to _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,50,230.16,235.32999999999998,_support the whole workflow of purchasing a product, or choosing a product. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,51,236.732,240.3,_In this era, after the common search engines already provide a good support. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,52,240.3,244.19,_For example, you can sometimes look at the reviews, and then if you want to buy it, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,53,244.19,249.04,you can just click on the button to go the shopping site and directly get it done. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,54,249.04,252.84,_But it does not provide a, a good task support for many other tasks. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,55,252.84,254.72,_For example, for researchers, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,56,254.72,258.8,you might want to find the realm in the literature or site of the literature. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,57,258.8,266.55,_And then, there's no, not much support for finishing a task such as writing a paper. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,58,266.55,271.13,_So, in general, I think, there are many opportunities in the wait. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,59,271.13,274.98,_So in the following few slides, I'll be talking a little bit more about some _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,60,274.98,279.9,_specific ideas or thoughts that hopefully, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,61,279.9,283.72,can help you in imagining new application possibilities. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,62,283.72,291.33,Some of them might be already relevant to what you are currently working on. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,63,291.33,295.37,_In general, we can think about any intelligent system, especially intelligent _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,64,295.37,302.39,_information system, as we specified by these these three nodes. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,65,302.39,305.68,_And so if we connect these three into a triangle, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,66,305.68,309.25,then we'll able to specify an information system. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,67,309.25,312.48,And I call this Data-User-Service Triangle. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,68,312.48,318.11,So basically the three questions you ask would be who are you serving and 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,69,318.11,323.47,what kind of data are you are managing and what kind of service you provide. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,70,324.58,329.36,_Right there, this would help us basically specify in your system. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,71,330.65,333.4,And there are many different ways to connect them depending on 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,72,333.4,336.04,_how you connect them, you will have a different kind of systems. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,73,336.04,337.65,So let me give you some examples. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,74,337.65,340.47,_On the top, you can see different kinds of users. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,75,340.47,345.25,_On the left side, you can see different types of data or information, and _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,76,345.25,348.74,_on the bottom, you can see different service functions. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,77,348.74,351.76,Now imagine you can connect all these in different ways. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,78,351.76,355.99,_So, for example, you can connect everyone with web pages, and _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,79,355.99,359.14,_the support search and browsing, what do you get? _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,80,359.14,361.05,_Well, that's web search, right? _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,81,362.44,367.68,What if we connect UIUC employees with organization documents or enterprise 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,82,367.68,372.72,_documents to support the search and browsing, but that's enterprise search. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,83,372.72,377.11,If you connect the scientist with literature information 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,84,377.11,382.05,_to provide all kinds of service, including search, browsing, or _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,85,382.05,388.31,_alert of new random documents or mining analyzing research trends, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,86,388.31,391.49,or provide the task with support or decision support. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,87,391.49,396.6,_For example, we might be, might be able to provide a support for _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,88,396.6,400.14,automatically generating related work section for 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,89,400.14,404.44,_a research paper, and this would be closer to task support. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,90,404.44,405.27,Right? So then 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,91,405.27,408.01,we can imagine this would be a literature assistant. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,92,408.01,412.8,If we connect the online shoppers with blog articles or product reviews 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,93,413.89,419.825,then we can help these people to improve shopping experience. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,94,419.825,425.465,_So we can provide, for example data mining capabilities to analyze the reviews, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,95,425.465,431.95,_to compare products, compare sentiment of products and to provide task support or _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,96,431.95,435.95,decision support to have them choose what product to buy. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,97,435.95,441.51,_Or we can connect customer service people with emails from the customers, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,98,442.63,447.66,_and, and we can imagine a system that can provide a analysis _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,99,447.66,451.46,of these emails to find that the major complaints of the customers. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,100,451.46,455.15,We can imagine a system we could provide task support 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,101,455.15,459.63,by automatically generating a response to a customer email. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,102,459.63,465.72,Maybe intelligently attach also a promotion message 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,103,465.72,469.83,_if appropriate, if they detect that that's a positive message, not a complaint, and _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,104,469.83,475.29,then you might take this opportunity to attach some promotion information. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,105,475.29,477.77,_Whereas if it's a complaint, then you might be able to _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,106,479.51,483.81,automatically generate some generic response first and 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,107,483.81,488.79,_tell the customer that he or she can expect a detailed response later, etc. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,108,488.79,494.21,All of these are trying to help people to improve the productivity. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,109,495.57,499.85,So this shows that the opportunities are really a lot. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,110,499.85,502.09,It's just only restricted by our imagination. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,111,502.09,507.4,_So this picture shows the trend of the technology, and also, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,112,507.4,513.77,_it characterizes the, intelligent information system in three angles. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,113,513.77,519.065,_You can see in the center, there's a triangle that connects keyword queries _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,114,519.065,521.225,to search a bag of words representation. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,115,521.225,526.721,That means the current search engines basically provides search support 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,116,526.721,534.085,to users and mostly model users based on keyword queries 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,117,534.085,539.105,and sees the data through bag of words representation. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,118,539.105,546.19,So it's a very simple approximation of the actual information in the documents. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,119,546.19,548.5,But that's what the current system does. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,120,548.5,552.15,_It connects these three nodes in such a simple way, or _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,121,552.15,557.655,_it only provides a basic search function and doesn't really understand the user, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,122,557.655,564.405,and it doesn't really understand that much information in the documents. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,123,564.405,571.862,_Now, I showed some trends to push each node toward a more advanced function. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,124,571.862,575.332,_So think about the user node here, right? _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,125,575.332,579.432,_So we can go beyond the keyword queries, look at the user search history, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,126,579.432,583.882,_and then further model the user completely to understand the, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,127,583.882,589.622,_the user's task environment, task need context or other information. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,128,589.622,595.12,_Okay, so this is pushing for personalization and complete user model. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,129,595.12,598.63,_And this is a major direction in research in, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,130,598.63,601.81,in order to build intelligent information systems. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,131,601.81,605.81,_On the document side, we can also see, we can _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,132,605.81,610.64,go beyond bag of words implementation to have entity relation representation. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,133,610.64,616.04,_This means we'll recognize people's names, their relations, locations, etc. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,134,616.04,620.43,And this is already feasible with today's natural processing technique. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,135,620.43,624.13,And Google is the reason the initiative on the knowledge graph.

5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,137,628.31,633.82,_And once we can get to that level without initiating robust manner at larger scale, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,138,633.82,638.17,it can enable the search engine to provide a much better service. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,139,638.17,641.47,In the future we would like to have 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,140,641.47,645.45,_knowledge representation where we can add perhaps inference rules, and _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,141,645.45,647.75,then the search engine would become more intelligent. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,142,649.39,653.49,_So this calls for large-scale semantic analysis, and _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,143,653.49,657.15,perhaps this is more feasible for vertical search engines. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,144,657.15,659.8,It's easier to make progress in the particular domain. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,145,659.8,661.24,_Now on the service side, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,146,661.24,665.92,we see we need to go beyond the search of support information access in general. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,147,667.51,673.702,So search is only one way to get access to information as well recommender 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,148,673.702,679.98,systems and push and pull so different ways to get access to random information. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,149,679.98,681.63,_But going beyond access, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,150,681.63,685.82,_we also need to help people digest the information once the information is found, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,151,685.82,690.56,and this step has to do with analysis of information or data mining. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,152,690.56,695.54,We have to find patterns or convert the text information into 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,153,695.54,698.865,real knowledge that can be used in application or 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,154,698.865,703.055,actionable knowledge that can be used for decision making.

5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,157,712.58,714.0,_Right, so this is a trend. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,158,714.0,719.37,_And, and, and so basically, in this dimension, we anticipate _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,159,719.37,724.21,in the future intelligent information systems will provide intelligent and

5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,161,726.94,731.2,_Now I should also emphasize interactive here, because it's important to optimize _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,162,731.2,736.79,the combined intelligence of the users and the system. 
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,163,736.79,742.14,_So we, we can get some help from users in some natural way. _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,164,742.14,746.97,_And we don't have to assume the system has to do everything when the human, _

5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,166,752.29,757.27,_then the combined intelligence will be high and in general, _
5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,167,757.27,761.01,we can minimize the user's overall effort in solving problem.

5 - 9 - 4.5 Future of Web Search (00-13-09).srt,169,767.947,772.582,and this hopefully can provide us with some insights about
