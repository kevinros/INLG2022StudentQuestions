5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,2,7.253,9.711,This lecture is about recommender systems. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,3,12.711,19.39,_So, so far we have talked about a lot of aspects of search engines. _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,4,19.39,24.05,_And we have talked about the problem of search and the ranking problem, _

5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,7,36.27,41.26,_This is partly because we know that web search engines are, _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,8,41.26,44.98,_by far, the most important applications of text retrieval. _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,9,44.98,49.82,And they are the most useful tools to help people convert big raw text 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,10,49.82,53.889,data into a small set of relevant documents. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,11,56.33,61.5,Another reason why we spend so many lectures on search engines is because 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,12,61.5,67.09,many techniques used in search engines are actually also very useful for 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,13,67.09,70.14,_recommender systems, which is the topic of this lecture. _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,14,71.56,76.84,_And so overall the two systems are actually well connected, _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,15,76.84,79.11,and there are many techniques that are shared by them. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,16,82.69,86.45,So this is a slide that you have seen before when we talked about 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,17,86.45,90.23,the two different modes of text access pull and push. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,18,91.244,96.81,_And, we mentioned that recommender systems are the main systems to serve _

5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,23,116.562,120.2,So a recommender system is sometimes called a filtering system. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,24,120.2,125.67,And it's because recommending useful items to people is like 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,25,125.67,130.764,discarding or filtering out the useless articles. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,26,130.764,134.37,_So in this sense, they are kind of similar. _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,27,136.07,140.12,_And in all the cases, the system must make a binary decision. _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,28,140.12,145.76,_And usually, there is a dynamic source of information items, _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,29,145.76,150.72,_and you have some knowledge about the user's interest, and then the system would _

5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,31,154.66,159.289,And then if it is interesting then the system would recommend the article to

5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,34,169.52,170.97,Will U like item X? 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,35,170.97,176.868,_And there are two ways to answer this question if you think about it, right? _

5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,37,180.04,183.68,then we can see if X is actually like those items. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,38,185.61,191.76,_The other is to look at who likes X ,and we can see if this user looks like a, _

5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,40,196.0,198.64,And these strategies can be combined. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,41,198.64,200.8,If we follow the first strategy and

5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,44,211.46,217.05,_If we look at the second strategy then, this will compare users. _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,45,217.05,220.64,_And in this case, we're exploiting user similarity, _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,46,220.64,223.11,and the technique is often called a collaborative filtering. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,47,226.01,229.19,So let's first look at the content-based filtering system. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,48,229.19,231.53,This is what a system would look like.

5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,51,242.21,245.285,It maintains the profile to keep track of the user's interest. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,52,246.535,250.99,_And then there is a utility function to guide the user to make decisions, and _
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,53,250.99,253.955,I'll explain the utility of the function in a moment. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,54,253.955,257.977,It helps the system decide where to set the threshold. 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,55,257.977,260.977,And then the accepted documents will be those that have passed 
5 - 10 - 4.6 Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 1  (00-12-55).srt,56,260.977,263.457,the threshold according to the classifier.
