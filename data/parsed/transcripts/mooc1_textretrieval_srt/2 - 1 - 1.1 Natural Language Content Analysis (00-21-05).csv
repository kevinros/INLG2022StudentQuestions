2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,3,13.587,15.499,_As you see from this picture, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,4,15.499,19.54,this is really the first step to process any text data. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,5,19.54,22.06,Text data are in natural languages. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,6,22.06,26.99,_So, computers have to understand natural languages to some extent in _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,7,26.99,31.98,_order to make use of the data, so that's the topic of this lecture. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,8,31.98,33.91,We're going to cover three things. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,9,33.91,38.63,_First, what is natural language processing, which is a main technique for _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,10,38.63,41.73,processing natural language to obtain understanding?

2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,12,47.01,48.36,natural language processing. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,13,49.54,53.47,_Finally, we're going to cover the relation between natural language processing and _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,14,53.47,54.9,text retrieval. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,15,54.9,57.27,_First, what is NLP? _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,16,57.27,60.66,_Well, the best way to explain it is to think about, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,17,60.66,65.89,if you see a text in a foreign language that you can't understand. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,18,66.99,70.99,_Now, what you have to do in order to understand that text? _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,19,70.99,73.21000000000001,This is basically what computers are facing. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,20,73.21000000000001,75.14,_Right? So, looking at the simple sentence like, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,21,75.14,77.65,a dog is chasing a boy on the playground. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,22,78.73,82.53999999999999,_We don't have any problems understanding this sentence, but _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,23,82.53999999999999,85.95,imagine what the computer would have to do in order to understand it. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,24,85.95,87.82,_For in general, it would have to do the following. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,25,87.82,94.31,_First, it would have to know dog is a noun, chasing's a verb, et cetera. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,26,94.31,98.28999999999999,_So, this is a code lexile analysis or part of speech tagging. _

2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,28,102.22999999999999,103.93,_So, that's a first step. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,29,103.93,107.47999999999999,_After that, we're going to figure out the structure of the sentence. _

2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,31,110.46000000000001,114.27000000000001,dog would go together to form a noun phrase. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,32,115.71000000000001,120.21,_And, we won't have dog and is to go first, right. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,33,120.21,122.969,_And, there are some structures that are not just right. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,34,124.47,129.63,_But, this structure shows what we might get if we look at the sentence and _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,35,129.63,131.85,try to interpret the sentence. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,36,131.85,133.95,_Some words would go together first, and _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,37,133.95,135.64,then they will go together with other words. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,38,136.64,140.2,_So here, we show we have noun phrases as intermediate components and _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,39,140.2,141.51,then verb phrases. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,40,141.51,143.67000000000002,_Finally, we have a sentence. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,41,143.67000000000002,148.44,_And, you get this structure, we need to do something called a syntactic analysis, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,42,148.44,149.44,or parsing. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,43,149.44,150.64,_And, we may have a parser, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,44,150.64,154.98,a computer program that would automatically create this structure.

2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,47,160.44,164.06,_So, we have to go further through semantic analysis. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,48,164.06,165.32999999999998,_In our mind, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,49,165.32999999999998,171.25,we usually can map such a sentence to what we already know in our knowledge base. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,50,171.25,173.93,_And for example, you might imagine a dog that looks like that, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,51,173.93,176.8,there's a boy and there's some activity here. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,52,176.8,179.69,_But for computer, will have to use symbols to denote that. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,53,179.69,181.04,All right. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,54,181.04,185.22,_So, we would use the symbol d1 to denote a dog. _

2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,56,192.65,195.4,_Now, there is also a chasing activity that's happening here, so _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,57,195.4,199.15,_we have the relation chasing here, that connects all these symbols. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,58,199.15,203.909,_So, this is how a computer would obtain some understanding of this sentence. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,59,205.92000000000002,211.59,_Now from this representation, we could also further infer some other things, _

2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,64,224.47,225.34,All right.

2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,66,226.18,230.88,you can see computers could also infer that this boy may be scared.

2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,72,245.16,248.74,This is called pragmatic analysis.

2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,272,1043.435,1048.86,search tasks are solved relatively easy such a representation is often sufficient. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,273,1048.86,1052.06,_And that's also the representation that the major search engines today, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,274,1052.06,1054.06,like Google or Bing are using. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,275,1055.76,1058.112,Of course I put in in parentheses but not all. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,276,1058.112,1062.237,Of course there are many queries that are not answered well by the current search 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,277,1062.237,1065.3,_engines, and they do require a representation _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,278,1065.3,1068.31,that would go beyond bag of words representation. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,279,1068.31,1072.051,_That would require more natural language processing, to be done. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,280,1072.051,1076.78,There is another reason why we have not used the sophisticated NLP 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,281,1076.78,1081.97,_techniques in modern search engines, and that's because some retrieval techniques _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,282,1081.97,1085.4,actually naturally solve the problem of NLP. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,283,1085.4,1089.25,_So, one example, is word sense disambiguation. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,284,1089.25,1091.06,Think about a word like java. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,285,1091.06,1093.915,It could mean coffee or it could mean program language. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,286,1095.07,1098.08,If you look at the word alone it would be ambiguous. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,287,1098.08,1103.04,_But when the user uses the water in the query, usually there are other words. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,288,1103.04,1106.24,For example I'm looking for usage of Java applet. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,289,1106.24,1111.99,When I have applet there that implies Java means program language. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,290,1111.99,1115.04,And that context can help us naturally 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,291,1115.04,1119.68,_prefer documents where Java is referring to program language, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,292,1119.68,1123.71,because those documents would probably match applet as well. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,293,1123.71,1127.722,_If java occurs in the document in a way that means coffee, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,294,1127.722,1133.25,_then you would never match applet, or with very small probability. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,295,1133.25,1135.4,Right. So this is a case when some retrieval 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,296,1135.4,1139.755,techniques naturally achieve the goal of word sense disambiguation. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,297,1141.53,1145.92,Another example is some technique called 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,298,1145.92,1151.362,feedback which we will talk about later in some of the lectures. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,299,1151.362,1157.41,_This tech, technique would allow us to add additional words to the query. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,300,1157.41,1162.1,And those additional words could be related to the query words. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,301,1162.1,1166.54,And these words can help match documents where the original query words 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,302,1166.54,1167.68,have not occurred. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,303,1167.68,1172.49,_So this achieves, to some extent, semantic matching of terms. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,304,1172.49,1175.35,So those techniques also helped us 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,305,1175.35,1178.89,bypass some of the difficulties in natural language processing. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,306,1180.53,1183.93,_However, in the long run, we still need deeper natural language processing _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,307,1183.93,1187.28,techniques in order to improve the accuracy of the current search engines. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,308,1187.28,1193.39,_And it's particularly needed for complex search tasks, or for question answering. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,309,1195.32,1198.91,Google has recently launched a knowledge graph. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,310,1198.91,1201.1,_And this is one step toward that goal, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,311,1201.1,1205.18,because knowledge graph would contain entities and their relations. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,312,1205.18,1209.035,And this goes beyond the simple bag of words representation. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,313,1209.035,1214.87,_And such technique should help us improve the search engine utility significantly, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,314,1214.87,1219.22,although this is a still open topic for research and exploration. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,315,1219.22,1225.48,_In sum, in this lecture we'll talk about what is NLP and we've talked _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,316,1225.48,1230.54,_about the state of the art techniques, what we can do, what we cannot do. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,317,1230.54,1234.53,_And finally, we also explained why bag of words representation _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,318,1234.53,1239.42,remains the dominant representation used in modern search engines even though 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Natural Language Content Analysis (00-21-05).srt,319,1239.42,1242.696,deeper NLP would be needed for future search engines.
