2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,4,17.458,22.11,This is the continued discussion of the Vector Space Model. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,5,22.11,30.01,We're going to focus on how to improve the instant changing of this model. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,6,30.01,34.934,_In a previous lecture, you have seen that with simple _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,7,34.934,39.477,_situations of the Vector Space Model, we can come up with _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,8,39.477,44.211,_a simple scoring function that would give us, basically, _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,9,44.211,49.44,a count of how many unique query terms are matching the document. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,10,50.57,56.902,We also have seen that this function has a problem as shown on this slide. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,11,56.902,60.26,_In particular, if you look at these three documents, _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,12,60.26,65.23,they will all get the same score because they match the three unique query words. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,13,66.28,70.53999999999999,_But intuitively we would like, d4 to be ranked above d3. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,14,70.53999999999999,73.07,And d2 is really non relevant. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,15,74.76,80.47,So the problem here is that this function couldn't capture 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,16,80.47,82.59,the following characteristics. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,17,82.59,87.28,_First, we would like to give more gratitude to d4 _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,18,87.28,92.184,because it matches the presidential more times than d3.

2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,21,103.09,104.97999999999999,It doesn't really carry that much content. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,22,107.47,108.94,_So, in this lecture, _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,23,108.94,112.191,let's see how we can improve the model to solve these two problems. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,24,113.95,119.99000000000001,It's worth thinking at this point about why do we have these four problems. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,25,121.42,124.69,If we look back at the assumptions we have made 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,26,124.69,128.996,_while substantiating the Vector Space Model, we will realize that _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,27,128.996,135.2,the problem is really coming from some of the assumptions. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,28,135.2,139.493,_In particular, it has to do with how we place the vectors in the vector space. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,29,142.115,145.301,_So then, naturally, in order to fix these problems, _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,30,145.301,147.598,we have to revisit those assumptions. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,31,147.598,151.559,_Perhaps, you will have to use different ways to _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,32,151.559,154.735,instantiate the Vector Space Model. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,33,154.735,161.448,_In particular, we have to place the vectors in a different way. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,34,161.448,165.722,_So, let's see how can we prove this? _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,35,165.722,170.71,_Well, our natural thought is in order to consider multiple times of a term _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,36,170.71,172.47,in a document. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,37,172.47,177.27,We should consider the term frequency instead of just the absence or presence. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,38,177.27,182.9,In order to consider the difference between a document where a query 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,39,182.9,187.62,term occurred multiple times and the one where the query term occurred just once. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,40,187.62,193.13,_We have to concede a term frequency, the count of a term being in the document. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,41,193.13,198.2,_In the simplest model, we only model the presence and absence of a term. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,42,198.2,205.32999999999998,We ignore the actual number of times that a term occurs in a document. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,43,205.32999999999998,206.75,So let's add this back. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,44,206.75,211.588,So we're going to do then represent a document by a vector with 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,45,211.588,214.34,term frequency as element. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,46,214.34,220.2,_So, that is to say, now, the elements of both the query vector and _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,47,220.2,223.87,_the document vector will not be zero once, but _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,48,223.87,229.49,instead there will be the counts of a word in the query or the document. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,49,232.13,235.21,So this would bring additional information about the document. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,50,235.21,240.64,So this can be seen as a more accurate representation of our documents. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,51,240.64,243.88,_So, now let's see what the formula would look like if we change _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,52,243.88,245.48,this representation. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,53,245.48,250.39,_So as you see on this slide, we still use that product, and, _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,54,250.39,254.27,so the formula looks very similar in the form. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,55,254.27,258.9,_In fact, it looks identical, but inside of the sum of cos xi and _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,56,258.9,260.39,yi are now different. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,57,261.39,268.34,They're now the counts of words i in the query and the document. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,58,270.45,275.91700000000003,_Now at this point, I also suggest you to pause the lecture for moment and _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,59,275.91700000000003,281.86,just we'll think about how we have interpret the score of this new function. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,60,281.86,287.71,It's doing something very similar to what the simplest VSM is doing. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,61,287.71,290.07,_But because of the change of the vector, _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,62,291.32,293.079,now the new score has a different interpretation. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,63,294.28,295.27,Can you see the difference? 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,64,296.39,300.17,And it has to do with the consideration of multiple 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,65,300.17,303.36,occurrences of the same time in the document. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,66,303.36,306.448,_More importantly, we''ll try to know whether this would fix the problem of _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,67,306.448,307.86,the simplest vector space model. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,68,307.86,312.31,_So, let's look at the this example again. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,69,312.31,316.66,_So suppose, we change the vector to term frequency vectors. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,70,316.66,320.628,_Now, let's look at these three documents again. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,71,320.628,325.94,The query vector is the same because all these words occurred exactly once 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,72,325.94,327.23,in the query. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,73,327.23,329.36,So the vector is still 0 1 vector. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,74,331.21,335.8,_And in fact, d2 is also essential in representing _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,75,335.8,340.12,the same way because none of these words has been repeated many times. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,76,340.12,344.642,_As a result, the score is also the same, still three. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,77,344.642,349.655,The same issue for d3 and we still have a 3. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,78,349.655,353.807,_But d4 would be different, because now, _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,79,353.807,357.391,presidential occurred twice here. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,80,357.391,364.022,So the end in the four presidential in the [INAUDIBLE] would be 2 instead of 1. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,81,364.022,368.327,_As a result, now the score for d4 is higher. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,82,368.327,369.875,It's a four now. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,83,369.875,374.117,_So this means, by using term frequency, _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,84,374.117,379.101,we can now rank d4 above d2 and d3 as we hope to. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,85,379.101,383.83,So this solve the problem with default. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,86,386.19,392.69,_But, we can also see that d2 and d3 are still featured in the same way. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,87,392.69,400.43,_They still have identical scores, so it did not fix the problem here. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,88,400.43,402.975,_So, how can we fix this problem? _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,89,402.975,409.36,_We would like, to give more credit for matching presidential than matching about. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,90,409.36,412.11,But how can we solve the problem in a general way? 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,91,413.29,417.89,Is there any way to determine which word should be treated more importantly and 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,92,417.89,421.27,_which word can be, basically ignored. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,93,422.72,423.84,About is such a word. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,94,425.17,429.68,_And which it does not really carry that much content, _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,95,429.68,431.76,we can essentially ignore that.

2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,99,441.245,444.718,But computation how can we capture that? 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,100,444.718,447.86,_So again, I encourage you to think a little bit about this. _
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,101,449.46,452.532,Can you come up with any statistical approaches to somehow 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,102,452.532,454.67,distinguish presidential from about.

2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,104,461.375,466.17,one difference is that a word like above occurs everywhere. 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,105,466.17,470.93,So if you count the currents of the water in the whole collection that we 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,106,470.93,474.21,would see that about as much higher for

2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,108,481.0,485.59,So this idea suggests that we could somehow 
2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,109,485.59,490.568,use the global statistics of terms or some other formation to try to

2 - 7 - 1.7 Vector Space Model- Improved Instantiation (00-16-52).srt,117,525.38,527.896,So how can we do this systematically?
