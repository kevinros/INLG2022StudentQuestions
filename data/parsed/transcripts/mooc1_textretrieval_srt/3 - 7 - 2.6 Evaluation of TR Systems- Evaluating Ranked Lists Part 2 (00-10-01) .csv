3 - 7 - 2.6 Evaluation of TR Systems- Evaluating Ranked Lists Part 2 (00-10-01) .srt,10,41.6,42.47,So how can we do that?

3 - 7 - 2.6 Evaluation of TR Systems- Evaluating Ranked Lists Part 2 (00-10-01) .srt,19,76.58,81.19,We talked about the different ways of combining precision and recall. 
3 - 7 - 2.6 Evaluation of TR Systems- Evaluating Ranked Lists Part 2 (00-10-01) .srt,20,81.19,87.34,And we conclude that the arithmetic mean is not as good as the MAP measure. 
3 - 7 - 2.6 Evaluation of TR Systems- Evaluating Ranked Lists Part 2 (00-10-01) .srt,21,87.34,88.42,But here it's the same.

3 - 7 - 2.6 Evaluation of TR Systems- Evaluating Ranked Lists Part 2 (00-10-01) .srt,51,181.62,183.48,_Right? So, which one would you use? _

3 - 7 - 2.6 Evaluation of TR Systems- Evaluating Ranked Lists Part 2 (00-10-01) .srt,55,198.51,200.25,So what does large value here mean? 
3 - 7 - 2.6 Evaluation of TR Systems- Evaluating Ranked Lists Part 2 (00-10-01) .srt,56,200.25,202.26,It means the query is relatively easy.

3 - 7 - 2.6 Evaluation of TR Systems- Evaluating Ranked Lists Part 2 (00-10-01) .srt,62,221.26,225.84,_those difficult queries, then gMAP would be preferred, right? _
