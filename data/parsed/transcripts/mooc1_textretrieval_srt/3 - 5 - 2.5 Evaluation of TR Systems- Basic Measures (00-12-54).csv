3 - 5 - 2.5 Evaluation of TR Systems- Basic Measures (00-12-54).srt,13,57.14,62.318,[SOUND] So let's now talk about how to actually quantify their performance.

3 - 5 - 2.5 Evaluation of TR Systems- Basic Measures (00-12-54).srt,131,599.81,602.3,It's probably very easy to imagine that 
3 - 5 - 2.5 Evaluation of TR Systems- Basic Measures (00-12-54).srt,132,602.3,605.07,_we simply retrieve all the document in the collection, _
3 - 5 - 2.5 Evaluation of TR Systems- Basic Measures (00-12-54).srt,133,605.07,609.27,then we have a perfect recall and this will give us 0.5 as the average.

3 - 5 - 2.5 Evaluation of TR Systems- Basic Measures (00-12-54).srt,145,657.16,660.86,It's important to think whether you have other ways to combine them.
