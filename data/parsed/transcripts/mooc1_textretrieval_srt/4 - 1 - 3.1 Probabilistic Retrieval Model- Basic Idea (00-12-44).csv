4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,35,174.54500000000002,176.754,So this is the basic idea.

4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,71,339.378,342.256,So let's take a look at some specific examples.

4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,81,382.878,386.503,So R is equal to 1 in only one of the two cases.

4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,127,544.628,548.503,_So note that here, we have made an interesting assumption here. _
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,128,548.503,553.49,_Basically, we, we're going to assume that whether the user types in this _
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,129,553.49,557.586,query has something to do with whether user likes the document. 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,130,557.586,562.192,_In other words, we actually make the foreign assumption and _
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,131,562.192,567.711,that is a user formula to query based on an imaginary relevant document. 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,132,567.711,570.471,_Well, if you just look at this as a conditional probability, _
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,133,570.471,572.711,it's not obvious we are making this assumption. 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,134,572.711,577.636,So what I really meant is that to use this new 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,135,577.636,582.931,conditional probability to help us score 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,136,582.931,587.255,then this new condition of probability. 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,137,587.255,591.4639999999999,We have to somehow be able to estimate this conditional 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,138,591.4639999999999,594.924,probability without relying on this big table.

4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,140,599.128,604.816,_And by making this assumption, we have some way to bypass this big table and _
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,141,604.816,608.712,try to just mortar how to use a formula to the query. 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,142,608.712,611.919,_Okay. So this is how you can simplify the, _
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,143,611.919,618.253,the general model so that we can give either specific function later. 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,144,618.253,621.4639999999999,So let's look at how this model works for our example. 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,145,621.4639999999999,622.52,_And basically, _
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,146,622.52,627.128,what we are going to do in this case is to ask the following question. 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,147,627.128,631.073,Which of these documents is most likely the imaginary relevant document in

4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,149,633.961,637.722,And so we ask this question and we quantify the probability and this 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,150,637.722,642.36,probability is a conditional probability of observing this query if a particular

4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,153,651.439,654.586,the likelihood of queries given each document.

4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,155,656.374,660.045,we can then rank these documents based on these values. 
4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,156,660.045,665.574,_So to summarize, the general idea of modern relevance in the probability _

4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,158,671.295,675.25,And then let the scoring function be defined based on this conditional

4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,161,682.091,686.03,_And in this case, we have a ranking function that's _

4 - 1 - 3.1 Probabilistic Retrieval Model- Basic Idea (00-12-44).srt,167,709.999,711.629,because q is a text.
