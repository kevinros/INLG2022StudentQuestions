5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,13,47.38,50.05,So this is not a random sample.

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,31,121.66,122.65,So how do we do that? 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,32,122.65,127.55,Well we could lower the threshold a little bit and do we just deliver some near

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,45,174.78,177.7,And that's also a difficult problem to solve. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,46,178.89,180.32,Now how do we solve these problems?

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,50,193.15,196.61,So you can just compute the utility on the training data for

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,58,223.22,226.47,So then we can just choose this threshold that gives the maximum 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,59,226.47,227.95,utility on the training data. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,60,229.35,236.87,Now but this of course doesn't account for exploration that we just talked about. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,61,236.87,239.26,And there is also the difficulty of bias.

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,63,241.53,247.3,_So in general, we can only get an upper bound or, for the true optimal threshold _

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,65,253.17,258.64,So it's possible that the discarded item might be actually interesting to the user. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,66,259.79,261.42,So how do we solve this problem? 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,67,261.42,267.19,Well we generally as I said we can lower the threshold to explore a little bit. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,68,267.19,270.76,So here's one particular approach called the beta-gamma threshold learning.

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,73,280.61,283.1,_And on the Y-axis, we show the Utility. _

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,76,288.51,293.82,But we can not imagine depending on the cut off position we will have a utility. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,77,293.82,299.83,That means suppose I cut at this position and that will be the utility. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,78,301.17,305.74,So we can for example I then find some cut off point.

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,82,321.98,325.68,As you can see at this cut off. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,83,325.68,327.63,The utility is 0.

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,89,345.855,351.492,it gives us a a safe point to explore the threshold.

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,91,356.052,359.622,So it's desirable to lower the threshold based on your training data. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,92,360.622,364.84,_So that means, in general, we want to set the threshold somewhere in this range. _
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,93,364.84,369.84,It's the when user off fault to control the the deviation from

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,95,373.2,376.56,So you can see the formula of the threshold will be just the incorporation 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,96,376.56,381.17,of the zero utility threshold and the optimal between the threshold.

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,99,393.72,398.45,Well this can depend on multiple factors and the one way to solve the problem is to 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,100,398.45,403.86,encourage this threshold mechanism to explore

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,102,408.62,412.95,we're not going to necessarily reach all the way to the 0 point. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,103,412.95,418.26,But rather we're going to use other parameters to further define alpha. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,104,418.26,421.03,And this specifically is as follows. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,105,421.03,424.25,So there will be a beta parameter to control. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,106,424.25,427.05,The deviation from the optimal threshold.

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,109,434.627,437.96,And so this can be just the adjustment factor. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,110,437.96,442.91,_But what's more interesting is this gamma parameter here, and you can see in this _

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,119,485.8,489.832,_But as we have seen many examples from the user, many data points, _
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,120,489.832,493.51,then we feel that we probably dont' have to explore more. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,121,493.51,497.89,_So this gives us a dynamic of strategy for exploration, right? _
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,122,497.89,501.47,_The more examples we have seen, the less exploration we are going to do. _
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,123,501.47,505.82,_So, the threshold will be closer to the optimal threshold. _
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,124,505.82,508.37,_So, that's the basic idea of this approach. _

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,126,514.01,516.03,_And, particularly effective. _

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,128,523.71,527.84,And explicitly addresses exploration-exploration tradeoff. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,129,527.84,533.75,_And it kind of uses a zero in this threshold point as a, a safeguard. _

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,134,548.64,552.14,_You know, so it's a safe strategy, a conservative strategy for exploration. _
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,135,553.26,558.03,_And the problem is, of course, this approach is purely heuristic. _
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,136,558.03,562.79,And the zero utility lower bound is also often too conservative.

5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,139,570.735,573.855,And this is a very active research area. 
5 - 11 - 4.6  Recommender Systems- Content-based Filtering - Part 2 (00-10-42).srt,140,575.225,580.4,So to summarize there are two strategies for
