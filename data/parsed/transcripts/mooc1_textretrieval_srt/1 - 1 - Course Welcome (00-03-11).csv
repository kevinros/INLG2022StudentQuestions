1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,2,8.484,12.312,welcome to the course in Text Retrieval and Search Engines. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,3,12.312,13.984,I'm Cheng Xiang Zhai. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,4,13.984,16.43,I have a nickname Cheng. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,5,16.43,19.29,I'm a professor of the Department of Computer Science at 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,6,19.29,21.964,the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,7,23.35,27.08,this first lecture is a basic introduction to the course. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,8,27.08,30.58,A brief introduction to what we we'll cover in the course. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,9,30.58,34.81,We're going to first talk about the data mining specialization since this course is 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,10,34.81,36.28,part of that specialization. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,11,36.28,41.39,And then we'll cover motivation objectives of the course. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,12,41.39,47.02,This will be followed by pre-requisites and course format and reference books. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,13,48.44,51.16,_And then finally we'll talk about the course schedule, _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,14,51.16,56.419,which has number of topics to be covered in the rest of this course. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,15,57.54,61.11,So the data mining specialization offered by the University of Illinois 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,16,61.11,66.08,at Urbana-Champaign is really to address the need for data mining techniques to 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,17,66.08,70.32,_handle a lot of big data, to turn the big data into knowledge. _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,18,70.32,75.27,_There are five lecture-based courses, as you see on the slide. _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,19,75.27,79.25,_Plus one capstone, project course in the end. _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,20,79.25,83.19,_I'm teaching two of them which is this course, Text Retrieval and _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,21,83.19,85.91,Search Engines and this one. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,22,85.91,89.85,So the two courses that I cover here are all about the text data. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,23,91.05799999999999,95.827,_In contrast, the other courses are covering more general techniques that can _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,24,95.827,98.47,be applied to all kinds of data. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,25,98.47,103.63499999999999,So Patent Discovery taught by the Professor Jowi Han and Cluster Analysis 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,26,103.63499999999999,109.47999999999999,again taught by him about the general data mining techniques to handle structure. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,27,109.47999999999999,112.33,The end and structure text data. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,28,112.33,117.229,_And data mine, data visualization covered by professor Jung Hart is about _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,29,117.229,120.29,the general visualization techniques. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,30,120.29,123.08,Again applicable to all kinds of data. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,31,123.08,125.1,So the motivation for this course. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,32,125.1,126.76,In fact also for 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,33,126.76,131.21,the other courses that I'm teaching is that we have a lot of text data. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,34,131.21,135.13,_And the data is everywhere, is growing rapidly, so _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,35,135.13,139.24,you must have been experiencing this growth. 
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,36,139.24,143.0,Just think about how much text data you're dealing with every day.

1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,41,157.45,163.07,_maybe a lot of tweets are being written, and a lot of emails are, are being sent. _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,42,163.07,168.483,_So, the amount of text data is beyond our capacity to understand them. _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,43,168.483,172.963,_Also, the amount of data makes it possible to actually analyze the data to discover _
1 - 1 - Course Welcome (00-03-11).srt,44,172.963,177.585,_interesting knowledge and that's what we meant by, harnessing big text data. _
