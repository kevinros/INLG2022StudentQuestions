2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,2,6.823,10.306,This lecture is a overview of text retrieval methods. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,3,10.306,17.84,In the previous lecture we introduced you to the problem of text retrieval. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,4,17.84,22.35,We explained that the main problem is to design a ranking function to rank 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,5,22.35,24.78,documents for a query. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,6,24.78,25.5,_In this lecture, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,7,25.5,31.04,we will give a overview of different ways of designing this ranking function. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,8,33.85,35.75,So the problem is the following. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,9,35.75,39.32,_We have a query that has a sequence of words, and _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,10,39.32,44.46,_a document that, that's also a sequence of words, and we hope to define the function _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,11,44.46,49.58,f that can compute a score based on the query and document. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,12,51.25,54.78,So the main challenge you here is with designing a good ranking function that can 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,13,54.78,60.235,_rank all the relevant documents, on top of all the non-relevant ones. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,14,60.235,64.06,Now clearly this means our function must be able to measure 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,15,64.06,69.23,the likelihood that a document d is relevant to a query q. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,16,69.23,75.21000000000001,That also means we have to have some way to define relevance. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,17,76.62,80.37,In particular in order to implement the program to do that we have to have 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,18,80.37,85.64,_a computational definition of relevance, and we achieve this goal by _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,19,85.64,90.39,_designing a retrieval model, which gives us a formalization of relevance. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,20,92.65,95.824,_Now, over many decades, researchers have designed _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,21,95.824,100.68,_many different kinds of retrieval models, and they fall into different categories. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,22,102.288,108.53,_First, one fair many of the models are based on the similarity idea. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,23,110.09,115.35,_Basically, we assume that if a document is more similar to the query _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,24,115.35,117.97,_than another document is, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,25,117.97,122.31,then we would say the first document is more relevant than the second one. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,26,122.31,125.33,_So in this case, the ranking function is defined as _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,27,125.33,128.55,the similarity between the query and the document. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,28,130.09,133.52,_One well known example in this case is vector space model, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,29,133.52,136.819,which we will cover more in detail later in the lecture. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,30,139.697,143.123,The second kind of models are called probabilistic models. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,31,143.123,148.68,_In this family of models, we follow a very different strategy. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,32,148.68,151.47,While we assume that queries and 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,33,151.47,156.54,_documents are all observations from random variables, and _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,34,156.54,161.26,_we assume there is a binary random variable called R here, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,35,162.37,165.48,to indicate whether a document is relevant to a query. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,36,166.53,172.28,We then define the score of document with respect to a query as is a probability 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,37,172.28,179.78,_that this random variable R is equal to 1, given a particular document and query. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,38,179.78,183.27,There are different cases of such a general idea. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,39,184.47,188.37,_One is classic probabilistic model, another is language model, yet _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,40,188.37,190.8,another is divergence-from-randomness model. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,41,192.336,195.83,_In a later lecture, we will talk more about the, one case, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,42,195.83,196.79,which is language model. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,43,198.16,201.74,The third kind of models of this is probabilistic inference. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,44,201.74,207.44,So here the idea is to associate uncertainty to inference rules. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,45,207.44,212.347,And we can then quantify the probability that we can show that the query 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,46,212.347,214.356,follows from the document. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,47,215.976,224.392,_Finally, there is also a family of models that are using axiomatic thinking. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,48,224.392,229.684,Here the idea is to define a set of constraints that 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,49,229.684,234.6,we hope a good retrieval function to satisfy. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,50,235.74,237.82,So in this case the problem is you seek 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,51,238.97,244.06,a good ranking function that can satisfy all the desired constraints. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,52,246.12,249.779,_Interestingly, although these different models are based on different thinking, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,53,251.09,257.92,in the end the retrieval function tends to be very similar. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,54,257.92,262.02,And these functions tend to also involve similar variables. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,55,262.02,266.91,_So now let's take a look at the, the common form of a state of that retrieval _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,56,266.91,272.76,model and examine some of the common ideas used in all these models. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,57,273.9,278.81,_First, these models are all based on the assumption _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,58,278.81,282.93,of using bag of words for representing text. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,59,282.93,287.5,And we explained this in the natural language processing lecture. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,60,287.5,291.45,Bag of words representation remains the main representation used in all 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,61,291.45,292.31,the search engines. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,62,293.62,298.53,_So, with this assumption, the score of a query like a presidential _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,63,298.53,303.3,_campaign news, with respect to a document d here, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,64,303.3,308.13,_would be based on scores computed at, based on each individual word. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,65,309.57,315.69,_And that means the score would depend on the score of each word, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,66,315.69,319.51,_such as presidential, campaign, and news. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,67,319.51,323.99,_Here we can see there are three different components, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,68,323.99,329.12,each corresponding to how well the document matches each of the query words. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,69,331.63,336.354,_Inside of these functions, we see a number of heuristics views. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,70,337.868,343.093,_So for example, one factor that affects the function g here is how _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,71,343.093,348.037,many times does the word presidential occur in the document? 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,72,348.037,350.267,This is called a Term Frequency or TF. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,73,350.267,355.665,We might also denote as c of presidential and d. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,74,355.665,360.928,In general if the word occurs more frequently in 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,75,360.928,367.779,the document then the value of this function would be larger. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,76,367.779,372.809,_Another factor is how long is the document, and _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,77,372.809,377.87,this is so to use the document length for score. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,78,377.87,382.84,_In general, if a term occurs in a long _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,79,382.84,388.43,_document that many times, it's not as significant as _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,80,388.43,392.69,if it occurred the same number of times in a short document. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,81,392.69,399.067,Because in the long document any term is expected to occur more frequently. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,82,399.067,404.445,_Finally, there is this factor called a document frequency, and that is we also _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,83,404.445,409.36,want to look at how often presidential occurs in the entire collection. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,84,409.36,414.271,_And we call this Document Frequency, or DF, of presidential. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,85,414.271,420.118,And in some other models we might also use a probability 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,86,420.118,424.577,to characterize this information. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,87,424.577,429.77,_So here, I show the probability of presidential in the collection. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,88,430.81,433.86,So all these are trying to characterize the popularity of 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,89,433.86,435.59,the term in the collection. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,90,435.59,438.43,_In general, matching a rare term in the collection _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,91,439.85,443.86,is contributing more to the overall score then matching a common term. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,92,445.72,450.523,So this captures some of the main ideas used in pretty much all the state of 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,93,450.523,452.349,the art retrieval models. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,94,454.0,458.25,_So now, a natural question is which model works the best? _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,95,460.15,466.58,_Now, it turns out that many models work equally well, so here I listed the four _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,96,466.58,472.12,major models that are generally regarded as a state of the art retrieval models. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,97,472.12,476.698,_Pivoted length normalization, BM25, query likelihood, PL2. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,98,476.698,482.285,_When optimized these models tend to perform similarly and this was, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,99,482.285,487.255,discussed in detail in this reference at the end of this lecture. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,100,487.255,493.135,_Among all these, BM25 is probably the most popular. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,101,493.135,497.75,_It's most likely that this has been used in virtually all the search engines, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,102,497.75,501.72,and you will also often see this method discussed in research papers. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,103,502.778,507.08,And we'll talk more about this method later in some other lectures. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,104,510.41,516.77,_So, to summarize, the main points made in this lecture are, first the design _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,105,516.77,521.58,_of a good ranking function pre-requires a computational definition of relevance, and _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,106,521.58,525.31,we achieve this goal by designing a proper retrieval model. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,107,527.17,532.26,_Second, many models are equally effective but we don't have a single winner here. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,108,532.26,535.55,_Researchers are still actively working on this problem, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,109,535.55,538.54,trying to find a truly optimal retrieval model. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,110,541.13,544.78,_Finally, the state of the art ranking functions tend to rely on _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,111,544.78,545.92,the following ideas. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,112,545.92,548.99,_First, bag of words representation. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,113,548.99,554.73,_Second, TF and the document frequency of words. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,114,554.73,559.465,Such information is used when ranking function to determine 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,115,559.465,564.14,_the overall contribution of matching a word, and document length. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,116,565.29,569.38,These are often combined in interesting ways and we'll discuss 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,117,569.38,574.21,how exactly they are combined to rank documents in the lectures later. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Overview of Text Retrieval Methods (00-10-10).srt,118,576.39,580.61,There are two suggested additional readings if you have time.
