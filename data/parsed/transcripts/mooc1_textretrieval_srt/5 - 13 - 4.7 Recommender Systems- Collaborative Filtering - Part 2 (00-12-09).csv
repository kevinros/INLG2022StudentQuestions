5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,15,86.15,90.31,So this n i is needed. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,16,90.31,95.5,Because we would like to normalize the ratings of objects by this user. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,17,95.5,99.18,So how do you do normalization?

5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,30,150.63,156.95,So the user u sub a is the user that we are interested in recommending items to. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,31,156.95,162.41,And we now are interested in recommending this o sub j.

5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,38,187.56,193.52,User A on object Oj is basically combination of 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,39,193.52,198.65,the normalized ratings of different users. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,40,198.65,203.95,_And in fact, here, we're picking a sum of all the users. _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,41,203.95,209.18,But not all users contribute equally to the average. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,42,209.18,212.378,And this is controlled by the weights. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,43,212.378,213.336,So this. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,44,214.587,220.35,Weight controls the inference of a user on the prediction. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,45,221.86,227.11,_And of course, naturally this weight should be related to the similarity _

5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,47,231.63,237.65,The more similar they are then the more contribution we would like

5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,49,243.95,245.53,So the formula is extremely simple. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,50,245.53,250.17,You're going to see it's a sum of all the possible users. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,51,250.17,253.88,_And inside the sum, we have their ratings, _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,52,253.88,257.38,well their normalized ratings as I just explained. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,53,257.38,261.4,The ratings need to be normalized in order to be comfortable with each other. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,54,262.69,266.73,And then these ratings are rated by their similarity. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,55,266.73,273.28,So we can imagine a W of A and I is just a similarity of user A user I. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,56,274.47,275.35,_Now, what's k here? _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,57,275.35,279.11,_Well, k is a simpler normalizer. _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,58,279.11,285.67,_It's just it's just one over the sum of all the weights, over all the users. _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,59,287.78,293.36,_And so this means, basically, if you consider the weight here together with k. _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,60,293.36,299.32,And we have coefficients or weights that would sum to one for all the users. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,61,299.32,305.69,_And it's just a normalization strategy, so that you get this predicted rating _

5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,63,313.64,314.56,Right? 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,64,314.56,320.32,_So, this is basically the main idea of memory-based approaches for _

5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,71,349.95,351.71,This would recover.

5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,80,391.39,393.15999999999997,And then you do the prediction and 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,81,393.15999999999997,399.06,then you compare the predicted ratings with their actual ratings.

5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,125,596.128,601.47,So there are some obvious ways to also improve this approach. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,126,601.47,607.07,And mainly would like to improve the user similarity measure. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,127,607.07,609.69,And there are some practical issues to deal with here as well. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,128,609.69,611.96,_So for example, there will be a lot of missing values. _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,129,611.96,612.97,What do you do with them? 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,130,612.97,618.05,_Well, you can set them to default values or the average ratings of the user. _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,131,618.05,620.31,And that will be a simple solution. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,132,620.31,626.4,But there are advantages to approaches that can actually try to predict those 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,133,626.4,633.01,missing values and then use the predicted values to improve the similarity. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,134,633.01,635.59,_So in fact, the memory database approach, _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,135,635.59,639.105,_you can predict those with missing values, right? _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,136,639.105,639.785,_So you can imagine, _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,137,639.785,644.075,you have iterative approach where you first do some preliminary prediction and 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,138,644.075,648.835,then you can use the predictor values to further improve the similarity function. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,139,648.835,654.84,Right so this is here is a way to solve the problem. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,140,654.84,658.67,_And the strategy of this in the effect of the performance of clarity filtering, _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,141,660.32,665.039,_just like in the other heuristics, we improve the similarity function. _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,142,666.3,670.46,Another idea which is actually very similar to the idea of IDF that we 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,143,670.46,675.18,_have seen in text research, is called the inverse user frequency or IUF. _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,144,675.18,683.169,Now here the idea is to look at the where the two users share similar ratings. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,145,684.55,690.02,_If the item is a popular item that has been aah, viewed by many people and _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,146,690.02,695.77,seemingly leads to people interested in this item may not be so interesting. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,147,696.78,700.61,But if it's a rare item and has not been viewed by many users. 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,148,700.61,702.878,_But, these two users [INAUDIBLE] to this item. _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,149,702.878,707.336,_And they give similar ratings, and it says more about their similarity, right? _
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,150,707.336,712.136,So it's kind of to emphasize more on similarity 
5 - 13 - 4.7 Recommender Systems- Collaborative Filtering - Part 2 (00-12-09).srt,151,712.136,716.461,on items that are not viewed by many users.
