1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,2,9.09,10.898,Text data is very special. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,3,10.898,16.58,_In contrast to the data captured by machines such as sensors, _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,4,16.58,19.8,text data is produced by humans. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,5,19.8,23.63,And they also are meant to be consumed by humans. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,6,23.63,26.3,And this has some interesting consequences. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,7,26.3,31.158,_Because it is produced by humans, it tends to have a lot of useful knowledge about _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,8,31.158,34.25,_people's' preferences, people's' opinions about everything. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,9,35.58,38.26,And that makes it possible to mine

1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,11,41.73,46.1,which could be very useful to build an intelligent system to help people. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,12,46.1,48.21,You can think about scientific literature or 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,13,48.21,53.49,so and it's a way to encode our knowledge about the world. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,14,53.49,60.2,_So it's very high quality content, yet we have difficulty digesting all the content. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,15,60.2,65.52,_Now as a result of the fact that text is consumed by we humans, _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,16,65.52,70.27,_we also need intelligent software tools to help people digest the content, or _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,17,70.27,73.28,otherwise we'd miss a lot of useful content. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,18,73.28,79.36,This slide shows that the human really plays important role in test data mining. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,19,79.36,81.81,_We have to consider human in the loop, and _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,20,81.81,84.61,we have to consider the fact that the text is generated by human. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,21,87.05,90.52,_So, here are some examples of useful text information systems. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,22,90.52,95.02000000000001,This is by no means a complete list of all applications. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,23,95.02000000000001,98.03,I categorize them into different categories. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,24,98.03,101.17,But you can probably imagine other kinds of applications. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,25,101.17,102.43,So let's take a look at some of them. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,26,102.43,105.72,_Search for example, we all know search engines is special. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,27,105.72,109.24000000000001,_Web search engines, iPad, all of you are using Google, or Bing, or _

1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,29,111.47,114.0,And we also have live research assistants. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,30,114.0,118.02000000000001,_And in fact, wherever you have a lot of text data, you would have a search engine. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,31,118.02000000000001,120.965,_So for example, you might have a search box on your laptop. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,32,120.965,123.46,_All right, to search content on your computer. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,33,124.5,127.38,_So that's one kind of application systems, but _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,34,127.38,130.17,we also have filtering systems or recommended systems. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,35,130.17,132.433,Those systems can push information to users. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,36,132.433,135.47,They can recommend useful information to users. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,37,135.47,139.05,_So again, use filters, spam filters. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,38,139.05,140.97,Literature the movie recommenders. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,39,140.97,144.32999999999998,Now not of them are necessary recommending the information to you.

1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,41,147.8,153.6,_this is actually to filter out the spams from your inbox, all right. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,42,153.6,158.59,But in nature these are similar systems in that they have to make a binary decision 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,43,158.59,162.7,regarding whether to retain a particular document or discard it. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,44,163.84,167.13,Another kind of systems are categorization systems. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,45,167.13,171.5,_So for example, in handling emails, _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,46,171.5,176.18,_you might prefer automatic, sorter that would automatically _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,47,176.18,180.73,sort incoming emails into a proper folders that you created. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,48,182.45,187.278,Or we might want to categorize product reviews into positive or negative. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,49,187.278,191.55,News agencies might be interested in 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,50,191.55,195.22,categorizing news articles into all kinds of subject categories. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,51,195.22,197.18,Those are all categorization systems. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,52,198.7,202.18,Finally there are also systems that might do more analysis. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,53,202.18,206.47,_And oh, you can say mine text data. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,54,206.47,209.02,And these can be text mining systems or 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,55,209.02,212.5,_information extraction systems, and they can be _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,56,212.5,217.44,used to analyze text data in more detail to discover potentially useful knowledge. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,57,217.44,221.05,For example companies might be interested in discovering 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,58,221.05,225.5,_major complaints from their customers based on the email messages that the, _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,59,225.5,227.43,they have received from the customers. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,60,227.43,232.59,_All right, so having a system to support that would _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,61,232.59,237.56900000000002,really help improve their productivity and the customer relations. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,62,239.016,242.975,_Also in business, intelligence companies are often interested in analyzing product _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,63,242.975,246.95,reviews to understand the relative strengths of their own products 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,64,246.95,249.06,in comparison with competitors. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,65,250.21,254.205,_And, and so these are all examples of these test mining systems. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,66,254.205,259.82,[INAUDIBLE] we have a lot of data in particular literature data. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,67,259.82,263.41700000000003,_So, there's also great opportunity of using computer systems _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,68,263.41700000000003,266.749,_to analyze the data to automatically read literature, and _

1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,70,270.295,272.774,And you can imagine many others. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,71,272.774,275.815,_So the point is that with so much text data, _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,72,275.815,281.84000000000003,we can build very useful systems to help people in many different ways. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,73,281.84000000000003,284.49,Now how do we build this systems? 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,74,284.49,289.65,Well these actually are the main technologies that we'll be talking 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,75,289.65,294.17,about in this course and the other course that I'm teaching for this specialization. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,76,294.17,297.93,The main techniques for building these systems and also for 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,77,297.93,302.53,harnessing the text data are text retrieval and text data mining. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,78,302.53,307.18,So I use this picture to show the relation between these two 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,79,307.18,308.84,some of the different techniques. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,80,308.84,311.56,_We started with big text data, right? _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,81,311.56,315.37,_But for any applications, we don't necessarily need to use all the data. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,82,316.38,322.49,_Often we only need the small subset of the most relevant data, and that's shown here. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,83,322.49,328.95,_So text retrieval is to convert big, raw text data into that small _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,84,328.95,333.52,subset of most relevant data that are most useful for a particular application. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,85,333.52,335.32,And this is usually done by search engines. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,86,335.32,337.90999999999997,And so this will be covered in this course. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,87,337.90999999999997,342.01,_After we have got a small amount of relevant data, _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,88,342.01,346.64,_we also need to further analyze the data to help people digest the data, or _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,89,346.64,350.04,to turn the data into actionable knowledge. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,90,350.04,354.3,_And this step is called text mining, where we use a number of techniques to _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,91,354.3,357.92,mine the data to get useful knowledge or pairings. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,92,357.92,361.57,And the knowledge can then be used in many different applications. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,93,361.57,365.573,_And this part, text mining, will be covered in the other course that I'm _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,94,365.573,368.42,teaching called Text Mining and Analytics. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,95,368.42,372.47,The emphasis of this course is on basic concepts and 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,96,372.47,374.48,practical techniques in text retrieval. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,97,375.75,379.15,More specifically we will cover how search engines work. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,98,379.15,381.34,How to implement a search engine. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,99,381.34,384.29,_How to evaluate a search engine, so that you know one search engine is _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,100,384.29,387.35,better than another or one method is better than another. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,101,387.35,390.61,How to improve and optimize a search engine system. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,102,390.61,392.64,And how to build a recommender system. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,103,394.08,398.3,We also hope to provide a hands on experience on multiple aspects. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,104,398.3,402.79,One is to create a test collection for evaluating search engines. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,105,402.79,408.24,This is very important for knowing which technique actually worked well. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,106,408.24,411.97,And whether your search engine system is really good for your application. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,107,413.0,417.92,The other aspect is to experiment with search engine algorithms. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,108,417.92,421.25,_In practice, you will have to face choices of different algorithms. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,109,421.25,424.09,So it's important to know how to compare them and 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,110,424.09,428.528,_to figure out how they work or maybe potentially, how to improve them. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,111,428.528,435.19,_And finally, we'll provide a platform for you to do search engine competition. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,112,435.19,440.01,Where you can compare your different ideas to see which idea works better 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,113,440.01,441.72,on some data set. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,114,441.72,445.45,The prerequisites for this course are minimum. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,115,445.45,448.65,_Basically we hope you have some basic concepts of computer science, for _

1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,117,450.39,454.27,_And we hope you will be comfortable with programming, especially in C++. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,118,454.27,458.78,because that's the language that we'll use for some of the programming assignments.

1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,122,472.255,475.168,We don't really have any required readings for this course. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,123,475.168,478.65,_That just means if you follow all the lecture videos carefully, _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,124,478.65,482.853,and you're suppose to know all the basic concepts and the basic techniques.

1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,132,511.26,516.34,_That's just the top of the map for the rest of the course, _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,133,516.34,520.72,and it shows the topics that we will cover in the remaining lectures. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,134,520.72,526.85,This picture also shows basic flow of information in a text information system. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,135,526.85,531.17,_So starting from the big text data, the first step is to do some natural language _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,136,531.17,537.69,_content analysis, because text data is in the form of natural language text. _
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,137,537.69,541.24,So we need to understand the text to some extent 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,138,541.24,543.67,in order to do something useful for the users. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,139,543.67,545.94,So this is the first topic that we will cover. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,140,545.94,551.53,And then on top of that as you can see there are two boxes here. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,141,551.53,556.33,Those are two types of systems that can be used to help people 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,142,556.33,559.14,get access to the most relevant data. 
1 - 2 - Course Introduction (00-10-45).srt,143,559.14,563.42,_Or in other words, those are the two kinds of systems that will convert _
