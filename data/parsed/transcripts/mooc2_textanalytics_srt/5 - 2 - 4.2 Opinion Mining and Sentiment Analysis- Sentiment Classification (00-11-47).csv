5 - 2 - 4.2 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Sentiment Classification (00-11-47).srt,2,7.163,9.92,lecture is about the sentiment classification.

5 - 2 - 4.2 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Sentiment Classification (00-11-47).srt,10,46.57,51.47,Sentiment classification can be defined more specifically as follows.

5 - 2 - 4.2 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Sentiment Classification (00-11-47).srt,37,171.677,176.115,and so these categories are not all that independent.

5 - 2 - 4.2 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Sentiment Classification (00-11-47).srt,50,222.26,226.43,_And this is also robust to spelling errors or recognition errors, right? _
5 - 2 - 4.2 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Sentiment Classification (00-11-47).srt,51,226.43,230.68,So if you misspell a word by one character and this representation actually would 
5 - 2 - 4.2 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Sentiment Classification (00-11-47).srt,52,230.68,235.62,allow you to match this word when it occurs in the text correctly.

5 - 2 - 4.2 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Sentiment Classification (00-11-47).srt,60,269.177,274.097,_communication, and so they are often good enough for many tasks. _

5 - 2 - 4.2 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Sentiment Classification (00-11-47).srt,127,562.82,567.92,you can also define a basic feature space with a lot of possible features for

5 - 2 - 4.2 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Sentiment Classification (00-11-47).srt,137,601.823,605.14,And we might consider using a different features space.
