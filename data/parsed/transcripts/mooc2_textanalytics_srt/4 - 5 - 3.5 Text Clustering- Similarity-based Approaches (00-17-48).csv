4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,2,7.027,11.32,This lecture is about the similarity-based approaches to text clustering. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,3,13.29,16.86,In this lecture we're going to to continue the discussion of how to do a text 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,4,16.86,17.57,clustering. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,5,18.77,22.84,_In particular, we're going to to cover different kinds of approaches _
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,6,22.84,28.34,_than generative models, and that is similarity-based approaches. _
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,7,28.34,33.99,So the general idea of similarity-based clustering is to explicitly 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,8,33.99,40.31,specify a similarity function to measure the similarity between two text objects. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,9,40.31,42.98,Now this is in contrast with 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,10,42.98,48.01,a generative model where we implicitly define the clustering bias 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,11,48.01,51.468,by using a particular object to function like a [INAUDIBLE] function. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,12,52.675,56.055,_The whole process is driven by optimizing the [INAUDIBLE,] but _
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,13,56.055,62.055,here we explicitly provide a view of what we think are similar. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,14,62.055,67.392,And this is often very useful because then it allows us to inject 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,15,67.392,72.272,any particular view of similarity into the clustering program. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,16,72.272,78.229,_So once we have a similarity function, we can then aim at optimally partitioning, _
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,17,78.229,83.96000000000001,to partitioning the data into clusters or into different groups. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,18,83.96000000000001,89.19,And try to maximize the inter-group similarity and 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,19,89.19,91.58,minimize the inter-group similarity. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,20,91.58,96.7,_That is to ensure the objects that are put into the same group to be similar, but _
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,21,96.7,101.59,the objects that are put into different groups to be not similar. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,22,101.59,105.155,_And these are the general goals of clustering, _
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,23,105.155,109.714,and there is often a trade off between achieving both goals. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,24,109.714,114.664,_Now there are many different methods for doing similarity based clustering, _
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,25,114.664,119.405,and in general I think we can distinguish the two strategies at high level.

4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,27,124.81,127.52,so this often leads to hierarchical clustering. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,28,127.52,132.99,_And we can further distinguish it two ways, to construct a hierarchy _
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,29,132.99,138.36,depending on whether we started with the collection to divide the connection. 
4 - 5 - 3.5 Text Clustering- Similarity-based Approaches (00-17-48).srt,30,138.36,143.02,_Or started with individual objectives and gradually group them together, so _
