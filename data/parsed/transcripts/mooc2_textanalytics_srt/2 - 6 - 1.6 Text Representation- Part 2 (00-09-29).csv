2 - 6 - 1.6 Text Representation- Part 2 (00-09-29).srt,95,423.099,428.326,And these different representations should in general

2 - 6 - 1.6 Text Representation- Part 2 (00-09-29).srt,106,475.46,479.78,That's a big advantage over other approaches that rely on

2 - 6 - 1.6 Text Representation- Part 2 (00-09-29).srt,115,514.34,518.46,Now they are very effective partly because the words

2 - 6 - 1.6 Text Representation- Part 2 (00-09-29).srt,117,525.61,531.12,So they are actually quite sufficient for representing all kinds of semantics.
