2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,5,21.51,23.78,So we're going to first talk about this. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,6,24.98,26.33,_And in particular, _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,7,26.33,31.54,natural language processing with a factor how we can present text data. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,8,33.21,38.23,And this determines what algorithms can be used to analyze and mine text data. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,9,40.82,44.991,We're going to take a look at the basic concepts in natural language first. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,10,46.33,48.97,And I'm going to explain these concepts 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,11,48.97,52.6,using a similar example that you've all seen here. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,12,52.6,55.65,A dog is chasing a boy on the playground. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,13,55.65,58.31,Now this is a very simple sentence. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,14,58.31,61.16,When we read such a sentence we don't have to think 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,15,61.16,65.2,about it to get the meaning of it. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,16,65.2,69.46000000000001,_But when a computer has to understand the sentence, _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,17,69.46000000000001,72.34,the computer has to go through several steps.

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,20,78.63,82.01,_And this is very easy, we can just look at the space. _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,21,82.01,86.136,_And then the computer will need the know the categories of these words, _

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,23,87.87,94.50999999999999,_So for example, dog is a noun, chasing's a verb, boy is another noun etc. _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,24,94.50999999999999,97.35,And this is called a Lexical analysis.

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,27,105.03,108.38300000000001,After that the computer also needs to figure out the relationship between

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,29,109.03999999999999,113.3,So a and dog would form a noun phrase.

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,31,117.59,121.378,And there is certain way for them to be connected together in order for 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,32,121.378,123.62,them to create meaning. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,33,123.62,126.469,Some other combinations may not make sense. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,34,127.72,132.62,_And this is called syntactical parsing, or _

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,39,147.43,149.74,But this is not semantics yet. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,40,149.74,154.53,So in order to get the meaning we would have to map these phrases and 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,41,154.53,159.86,these structures into some real world antithesis that we have in our mind. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,42,159.86,165.5,_So dog is a concept that we know, and boy is a concept that we know. _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,43,165.5,170.87,So connecting these phrases that we know is understanding. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,44,172.16,178.788,_Now for a computer, would have to formally represent these entities by using symbols. _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,45,178.788,183.63,_So dog, d1 means d1 is a dog. _

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,64,275.24,282.32,_So this means when saying a sentence, the person actually takes an action. _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,65,282.32,284.769,So the action here is to make a request.

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,70,304.91,306.45,This is very difficult. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,71,308.19,311.094,_Now, the main reason why natural language processing is very difficult, _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,72,311.094,314.82,it's because it's designed it will make human communications efficient. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,73,315.99,320.04,_As a result, for example, with only a lot of common sense knowledge. _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,74,321.25,325.15,_Because we assume all of us have this knowledge, _

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,76,329.78,331.36,That makes communication efficient. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,77,332.48,337.46,_We also keep a lot of ambiguities, like, ambiguities of words. _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,78,339.09000000000003,345.13,_And this is again, because we assume we have the ability to disambiguate the word. _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,79,345.13,348.8,_So, there's no problem with having the same word to mean _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,80,348.8,350.869,possibly different things in different context. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,81,352.61,355.88,Yet for a computer this would be very difficult 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,82,355.88,360.25,because a computer does not have the common sense knowledge that we do. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,83,360.25,363.62,So the computer will be confused indeed. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,84,363.62,366.98,And this makes it hard for natural language processing.

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,86,369.44,375.14,every step in the slide that I showed you earlier. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,87,376.55,379.38,Ambiguity is a main killer. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,88,379.38,382.82,_Meaning that in every step there are multiple choices, _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,89,382.82,386.79,and the computer would have to decide whats the right choice and 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,90,386.79,390.55,that decision can be very difficult as you will see also in a moment. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,91,391.69,392.3,_And in general, _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,92,392.3,397.53,we need common sense reasoning in order to fully understand the natural language. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,93,397.53,400.595,And computers today don't yet have that. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,94,400.595,402.82,That's why it's very hard for 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,95,402.82,407.31,computers to precisely understand the natural language at this point. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,96,408.31,411.28,So here are some specific examples of challenges. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,97,411.28,413.39,Think about the world-level ambiguity. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,98,413.39,416.94,_A word like design can be a noun or a verb, so _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,99,416.94,419.2,we've got ambiguous part of speech tag. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,100,420.98,426.19,_Root also has multiple meanings, it can be of mathematical sense, _

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,102,432.31,437.31,Syntactic ambiguity refers to different interpretations 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,103,439.44,441.67,of a sentence in terms structures. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,104,441.67,443.01,_So for example, _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,105,443.01,446.219,natural language processing can actually be interpreted in two ways. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,106,448.24,453.40999999999997,So one is the ordinary meaning that we 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,107,453.40999999999997,458.69,will be getting as we're talking about this topic. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,108,458.69,461.67,_So, it's processing of natural language. _
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,109,461.67,464.6,But there's is also another possible interpretation 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,110,464.6,467.19,which is to say language processing is natural. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,111,468.95,473.5,_Now we don't generally have this problem, but imagine for the computer to determine _

2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,113,479.04,483.53,Another classic example is a man saw a boy with a telescope. 
2 - 3 - 1.3 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 1 (00-12-48).srt,114,483.53,490.23,And this ambiguity lies in the question who had the telescope?
