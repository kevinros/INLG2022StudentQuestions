4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,2,6.538,10.52,This lecture is about evaluation of text clustering. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,3,12.83,18.24,So far we have talked about multiple ways of doing text clustering but 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,4,18.24,21.43,how do we know which method works the best? 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,5,22.95,25.54,So this has to do with evaluation. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,6,25.54,28.03,Now to talk about evaluation one must 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,7,28.03,31.48,go back to the clustering bias that we introduced at the beginning. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,8,32.56,36.77,_Because two objects can be similar depending on how you look at them, _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,9,37.78,41.91,we must clearly specify the perspective of similarity. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,10,41.91,46.2,_Without that, the problem of clustering is not well defined. _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,11,46.2,51.74,So this perspective is also very important for evaluation. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,12,51.74,53.35,_If you look at this slide, and _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,13,53.35,58.83,_you can see we have two different ways to cluster these shapes, and _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,14,58.83,63.64,_if you ask a question, which one is the best, or which one is better? _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,15,63.64,67.86,_You actually see, there's no way to answer this question without knowing whether _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,16,67.86,73.42,_we'd like to cluster based on shapes, or cluster based on sizes. _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,17,73.42,77.48,And that's precisely why the perspective on clustering bias is 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,18,77.48,78.68,crucial for evaluation. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,19,79.71000000000001,83.53,_In general, we can evaluate text clusters in two ways, _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,20,83.53,87.58,_one is direct evaluation, and the other indirect evaluation. _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,21,87.58,89.31,_So in direct evaluation, _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,22,89.31,94.06,_we want to answer the following questions, how close are the system-generated _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,23,94.06,97.15,clusters to the ideal clusters that are generated by humans? 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,24,98.58,103.03999999999999,So the closeness here can be assessed 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,25,104.42,110.33,from multiple perspectives and that will help us characterize the quality 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,26,110.33,115.32,_of cluster result in multiple angles, and this is sometimes desirable. _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,27,116.78999999999999,124.01,Now we also want to quantify the closeness because this would allow 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,28,124.01,128.5,us to easily compare different measures based on their performance figures. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,29,129.87,134.63,_And finally, you can see, in this case, we essentially inject the clustering bias _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,30,135.66,141.66,_by using humans, basically humans would bring in the the need or _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,31,141.66,144.26,desire to clustering bias. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,32,144.26,145.61,_Now, how do we do that exactly? _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,33,145.61,147.519,_Well, the general procedure would look like this. _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,34,148.59,153.29,_Given a test set which consists of a lot of text objects, _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,35,153.29,157.1,_we can have humans to create the ideal clustering result, that is, _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,36,157.1,162.39,we're going to ask humans to partition the objects to create the gold standard. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,37,162.39,168.49,And they will use their judgments based on the need of a particular application 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,38,168.49,174.47,_to generate what they think are the best clustering results, and this would be then _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,39,174.47,179.99,used to compare with the system generated clusters from the same test set. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,40,181.38,185.7,_And ideally, we want the system results to be the same as the human generated _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,41,185.7,188.65,_results, but in general, they are not going to be the same. _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,42,188.65,192.59,So we would like to then quantify the similarity between the system-generated 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,43,192.59,195.41,clusters and the gold standard clusters. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,44,195.41,200.11,And this similarity can also be measure from multiple perspectives and this will 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,45,200.11,206.75,_give us various meshes to quantitatively evaluate a cluster, a clustering result. _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,46,206.75,214.14,_And some of the commonly used measures include the purity, which measures whether _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,47,214.14,220.015,_a cluster has a similar object from the same cluster, in the gold standard. _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,48,220.015,225.54500000000002,And normalized mutual information is a commonly used measure 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,49,225.54500000000002,230.485,which basically measures based on the identity of 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,50,230.485,234.935,cluster of object in the system generally. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,51,234.935,240.225,How well can you predict the cluster of the object in the gold standard or 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,52,240.225,241.44,vice versa? 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,53,241.44,246.315,_And mutual information captures, the correlation between these cluster labels _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,54,246.315,251.1,and normalized mutual information is often 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,55,251.1,255.3,used for quantifying the similarity for 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,56,255.3,259.22,_this evaluation purpose, F measure is another possible measure. _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,57,261.34,264.405,Now again a thorough discussion of this evaluation and 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,58,264.405,268.81,these evaluation issues would be beyond the scope of this course. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,59,269.82,274.73,I've suggested some reading in the end that you can take a look 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,60,274.73,275.84000000000003,at to know more about that. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,61,276.95,279.83,So here I just want to discuss some high level ideas 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,62,279.83,283.83,that would allow you to think about how to do evaluation in your applications. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,63,283.83,288.12,The second way to evaluate text clusters is to do indirect evaluation. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,64,288.12,292.54,_So in this case the question to answer is, how useful are the clustering results for _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,65,292.54,295.12,the intended applications? 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,66,295.12,299.73,_Now this of course is application specific question, so _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,67,299.73,305.39,usefulness is going to depend on specific applications. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,68,307.14,311.18,_In this case, the clustering bias is imposed by the independent application _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,69,311.18,312.85,_as well, so _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,70,312.85,317.79,what counts as a best cluster result would be dependent on the application. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,71,319.098,325.12,Now procedure wise we also would create a test set with text objects for 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,72,325.12,329.86,the intended application to quantify the performance of the system. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,73,332.88,338.87,_In this case, what we care about is the contribution of _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,74,338.87,343.96,clustering to some application so we often have a baseline system to compare with. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,75,345.04,347.67,_This could be the current system for doing something, and _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,76,347.67,351.82,_then you hope to add a clustering to improve it, or _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,77,351.82,355.34000000000003,the baseline system could be using a different clustering method. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,78,355.34000000000003,359.94,_And then what you are trying to experiment with, and _

4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,80,363.11,366.911,_So in any case you have a baseline system work with, and then you add a clustering _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,81,366.911,370.11,algorithm to the baseline system to produce a clustering system. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,82,371.74,374.87,And then we have to compare the performance of your clustering system and 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,83,374.87,378.66,the baseline system in terms of the performance measure for 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,84,378.66,379.94,that particular application. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,85,381.07,385.62,So in this case we call it indirect evaluation of clusters because there's no 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,86,385.62,390.04,_explicit assessment of the quality of clusters, but _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,87,390.04,395.47,rather it's to assess the contribution of clusters to a particular application. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,88,397.35,400.57,_So, to summarize text clustering, _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,89,401.95,406.75,_it's a very useful unsupervised general text mining technique, and _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,90,406.75,412.86,it's particularly useful for obtaining an overall picture of the text content. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,91,412.86,416.96,_And this is often needed to explore text data, and _

4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,93,421.72,426.61,The second application or second kind of applications is through 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,94,426.61,429.8,discover interesting clustering structures in text data and 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,95,429.8,431.66,these structures can be very meaningful. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,96,433.33,438.752,There are many approaches that can be used to form text clustering and 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,97,438.752,445.59,we discussed model based approaches and some narrative based approaches. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,98,445.59,450.39,_In general, strong clusters tend to show up no matter what method is used. _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,99,450.39,455.35,Also the effectiveness of a method highly depends on whether the desired 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,100,455.35,460.4,_clustering bias is captured appropriately, and this can be done either through using _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,101,460.4,465.15,_the right generating model, the model design appropriate for the clustering, or _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,102,465.15,469.46,the right similarity function expressly define the bias. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,103,469.46,473.73,Deciding the optimal number of customers is a very difficult problem for

4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,105,479.51,483.885,and there's no training there how to guide us to select the best number of clusters. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,106,485.125,488.515,Now sometimes you may see some methods that can automatically determine 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,107,488.515,493.575,_the number of clusters, but in general that has some implied _

4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,111,511.92,515.65,And I should also say sometimes we can also use application to determine

4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,113,519.32,523.34,_then obviously you don't want to generate the 100 clusters, so _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,114,523.34,525.87,the number can be dictated by the interface design. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,115,526.88,533.47,_In other situations, we might be able to use the fitness to data _

4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,117,539.44,544.33,_And to do that, you can vary the number of clusters and _
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,118,544.33,546.17,watch how well you can fit the data. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,119,547.43,550.74,In general when you add a more components to a mixed model you should fit

4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,121,553.1,557.35,you can always set the probability of using the new component as zero. 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,122,557.35,563.93,_So you can't in general fit the data worse than before, but the question _

4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,128,586.59,592.206,So here's some suggested reading and this is particularly useful 
4 - 6 - 3.6 Text Clustering- Evaluation (00-10-11).srt,129,592.206,598.838,to better understand how the matches are calculated and clustering in general
