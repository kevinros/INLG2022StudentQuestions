2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,1,0.012,6.665,[SOUND] In 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,2,6.665,11.7,this lecture we give an overview of Text Mining and Analytics. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,3,13.743,19.83,_First, let's define the term text mining, and the term text analytics. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,4,19.83,24.2,The title of this course is called Text Mining and Analytics. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,5,25.59,31.25,_But the two terms text mining, and text analytics are actually roughly the same. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,6,32.67,36.37,_So we are not really going to really distinguish them, and _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,7,36.37,38.23,we're going to use them interchangeably. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,8,38.23,42.88,But the reason that we have chosen to use 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,9,42.88,47.72,_both terms in the title is because there is also some subtle difference, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,10,47.72,51.07,if you look at the two phrases literally. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,11,52.11,55.64,Mining emphasizes more on the process. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,12,55.64,61.683,So it gives us a error rate medical view of the problem. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,13,61.683,66.359,_Analytics, on the other hand emphasizes more on the result, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,14,67.6,69.9,or having a problem in mind. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,15,69.9,74.72,We are going to look at text data to help us solve a problem. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,16,76.01,79.94,_But again as I said, we can treat these two terms roughly the same. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,17,81.15,84.82,And I think in the literature you probably will find the same. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,18,84.82,87.82,So we're not going to really distinguish that in the course. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,19,89.85,95.45,Both text mining and text analytics mean that we 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,20,95.45,100.25,_want to turn text data into high quality information, or actionable knowledge. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,21,102.57,104.02000000000001,_So in both cases, we _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,22,105.83,110.67,have the problem of dealing with a lot of text data and we hope to. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,23,110.67,116.09,Turn these text data into something more useful to us than the raw text data. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,24,117.72999999999999,120.38,And here we distinguish two different results. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,25,120.38,124.53,_One is high-quality information, the other is actionable knowledge. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,26,125.74,128.68,Sometimes the boundary between the two is not so clear. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,27,129.85,131.69,But I also want to say a little bit about 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,28,132.78,137.59,these two different angles of the result of text field mining. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,29,139.25,142.982,_In the case of high quality information, we refer to more _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,30,142.982,147.715,concise information about the topic. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,31,148.895,154.20499999999998,Which might be much easier for humans to digest than the raw text data. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,32,154.20499999999998,157.04500000000002,_For example, you might face a lot of reviews of a product. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,33,158.26,162.7,A more concise form of information would be a very concise summary 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,34,162.7,166.57,of the major opinions about the features of the product. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,35,166.57,170.874,_Positive about, let's say battery life of a laptop. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,36,173.436,178.26,Now this kind of results are very useful to help people digest the text data. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,37,179.93,185.03,And so this is to minimize a human effort in consuming text data in some sense. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,38,186.25,189.88,The other kind of output is actually more knowledge. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,39,189.88,195.3,Here we emphasize the utility of the information or 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,40,195.3,197.19,knowledge we discover from text data. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,41,198.27,203.82999999999998,_It's actionable knowledge for some decision problem, or some actions to take. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,42,204.99,211.51,_For example, we might be able to determine which product is more appealing to us, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,43,211.51,216.27,or a better choice for a shocking decision. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,44,218.115,223.19,_Now, such an outcome could be called actionable knowledge, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,45,223.19,229.55,_because a consumer can take the knowledge and make a decision, and act on it. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,46,229.55,235.131,_So, in this case text mining supplies knowledge for optimal decision making. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,47,235.131,239.424,_But again, the two are not so clearly distinguished, so _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,48,239.424,243.281,we don't necessarily have to make a distinction. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,49,246.253,249.821,_Text mining is also related to text retrieval, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,50,249.821,254.38,which is a essential component in many text mining systems. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,51,255.91,260.434,_Now, text retrieval refers to finding relevant information from _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,52,260.434,262.38,a large amount of text data. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,53,264.14,270.21,So I've taught another separate book on text retrieval and search engines. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,54,271.71,274.68,Where we discussed various techniques for text retrieval.

2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,56,282.12,286.7,And it will be useful To know the background of text retrieval 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,57,286.7,290.01,of understanding some of the topics in text mining. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,58,291.75,294.35,_But, if you have not taken that book, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,59,294.35,299.44,_it's also fine because in this book on text mining and analytics, we're _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,60,299.44,303.26,going to repeat some of the key concepts that are relevant for text mining. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,61,303.26,306.54,But they're at the high level and 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,62,306.54,310.71,they also explain the relation between text retrieval and text mining. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,63,312.32,318.278,Text retrieval is very useful for text mining in two ways. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,64,318.278,323.2,_First, text retrieval can be a preprocessor for text mining. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,65,323.2,327.6,Meaning that it can help us turn big text data into 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,66,327.6,332.03,a relatively small amount of most relevant text data. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,67,332.03,335.18,Which is often what's needed for solving a particular problem. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,68,336.58,341.186,_And in this sense, text retrieval also helps minimize human effort. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,69,343.323,346.365,Text retrieval is also needed for knowledge provenance. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,70,346.365,350.976,And this roughly corresponds to the interpretation of text

2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,77,376.01,379.91,to verify whether a pattern is really reliable. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,78,379.91,383.83,_So this is a high level introduction to the concept of text mining, _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,79,383.83,389.53,and the relationship between text mining and retrieval. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,80,392.11,396.554,_Next, let's talk about text data as a special kind of data. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,81,399.689,405.60699999999997,Now it's interesting to view text data as data

2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,83,413.2,423.42,_So, this slide shows an analogy between text data and non-text data. _
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,84,423.42,427.832,And between humans as subjective sensors and

2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,86,436.29200000000003,441.377,So in general a sensor would monitor the real world in some way.

2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,99,502.05,508.44,And then humans will express what they have observed in the form of text data. 
2 - 1 - 1.1 Overview Text Mining and Analytics- Part 1 (00-11-43).srt,100,508.44,513.33,_So, in this sense, human is actually a subjective sensor that would also _
