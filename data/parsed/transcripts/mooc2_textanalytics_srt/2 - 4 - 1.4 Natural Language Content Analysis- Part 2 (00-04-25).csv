2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,2,10.218,13.988,So here are some specific examples of what 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,3,13.988,15.926,we can't do today and 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,4,15.926,21.97,part of speech tagging is still not easy to do 100% correctly. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,5,21.97,27.938,_So in the example, he turned off the highway verses he turned off the fan and _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,6,27.938,33.342,the two offs actually have somewhat a differentness in their active 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,7,33.342,39.633,categories and also its very difficult to get a complete the parsing correct. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,8,39.633,44.45,_Again, the example, a man saw a boy with a telescope can actually _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,9,44.45,48.4,be very difficult to parse depending on the context. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,10,48.4,52.278,Precise deep semantic analysis is also very hard. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,11,52.278,55.648,_For example, to define the meaning of own, _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,12,55.648,61.493,_precisely is very difficult in the sentence, like John owns a restaurant. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,13,61.493,64.737,So the state of the off can be summarized as follows. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,14,64.737,65.506,Robust and 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,15,65.506,71.07,general NLP tends to be shallow while a deep understanding does not scale up. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,16,72.43,78.565,_For this reason in this course, the techniques that we cover are in _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,17,78.565,83.61,_general, shallow techniques for analyzing text data and _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,18,83.61,89.63,mining text data and they are generally based on statistical analysis. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,19,89.63,94.50999999999999,So there are robust and general and they are in 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,20,96.53999999999999,99.55,the in category of shallow analysis. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,21,99.55,104.32,So such techniques have the advantage of being able to be 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,22,104.32,109.09899999999999,applied to any text data in any natural about any topic. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,23,109.09899999999999,115.425,_But the downside is that, they don't give use a deeper understanding of text. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,24,115.425,119.15899999999999,_For that, we have to rely on deeper natural language analysis. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,25,120.96,125.93,That typically would require a human effort to annotate 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,26,125.93,130.94,a lot of examples of analysis that would like to do and then computers can use 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,27,130.94,136.12,machine learning techniques and learn from these training examples to do the task. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,28,136.12,141.88,_So in practical applications, we generally combine the two kinds of techniques _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,29,141.88,149.15,with the general statistical and methods as a backbone as the basis. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,30,149.15,152.01,These can be applied to any text data. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,31,152.01,157.06,_And on top of that, we're going to use humans to, and you take more data and _

2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,33,162.77,168.64,especially for those important tasks to bring humans into the loop 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,34,168.64,175.17000000000002,to analyze text data more precisely. 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,35,175.17000000000002,180.036,But this course will cover the general statistical approaches 
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,36,180.036,184.177,_that generally, don't require much human effort. _
2 - 4 - 1.4 Natural Language Content Analysis- Part 2 (00-04-25).srt,37,184.177,189.386,_So they're practically, more useful that some of the deeper _
