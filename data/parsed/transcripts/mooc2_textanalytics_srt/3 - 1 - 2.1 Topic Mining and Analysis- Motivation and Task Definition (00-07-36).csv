3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,12,59.92,64.35,_In this lecture, we're going to talk about its motivation and the task definition. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,13,64.35,68.26,_So first of all, let's look at the concept of topic. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,14,68.26,72.6,_So topic is something that we all understand, I think, but _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,15,72.6,75.84,it's actually not that easy to formally define. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,16,75.84,80.42,_Roughly speaking, topic is the main idea discussed in text data. _

3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,43,184.8,188.68,and we're going to talk about a lot of techniques for doing this. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,44,188.68,192.92,In general we can view a topic as some knowledge about the world.

3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,59,255.62,258.95,Soon you are looking at topics in different locations. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,60,258.95,264.185,We might know some insights about people's opinions in different locations. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,61,266.15,269.9,So that's why mining topics is very important. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,62,269.9,274.54,_Now, let's look at the tasks of topic mining and analysis. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,63,274.54,279.38,_In general, it would involve first discovering a lot of topics, in this case, _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,64,279.38,280.81,k topics. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,65,280.81,285.43,_And then we also would like to know, which topics are covered in which documents, _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,66,285.43,286.6,to what extent. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,67,286.6,292.97,_So for example, in document one, we might see that Topic 1 is covered a lot, _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,68,292.97,297.39,Topic 2 and Topic k are covered with a small portion.

3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,73,315.873,319.995,_So now you can see there are generally two different tasks, or _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,74,319.995,325.76,_sub-tasks, the first is to discover k topics from a collection of text laid out. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,75,325.76,327.14,What are these k topics? 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,76,327.14,328.92,_Okay, major topics in the text they are. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,77,328.92,333.18,The second task is to figure out which documents cover which topics 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,78,333.18,334.43,to what extent. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,79,334.43,337.81,_So more formally, we can define the problem as follows. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,80,337.81,342.365,_First, we have, as input, a collection of N text documents. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,81,342.365,347.05,_Here we can denote the text collection as C, and _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,82,347.05,351.74,denote text article as d i. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,83,351.74,356.7,_And, we generally also need to have as input the number of topics, k. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,84,356.7,361.73,But there may be techniques that can automatically suggest a number of topics. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,85,361.73,366.735,_But in the techniques that we will discuss, which are also the most useful _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,86,366.735,372.34,_techniques, we often need to specify a number of topics. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,87,374.58,379.86,_Now the output would then be the k topics that we would like to discover, _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,88,379.86,383.21,in order as theta sub one through theta sub k. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,89,384.54,389.82,Also we want to generate the coverage of topics in each document of d sub i And 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,90,389.82,392.51800000000003,this is denoted by pi sub i j. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,91,393.562,398.073,And pi sub ij is the probability of document d sub i 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,92,398.073,401.29,covering topic theta sub j. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,93,401.29,405.45,_So obviously for each document, we have a set of such values to indicate to _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,94,405.45,407.83,_what extent the document covers, each topic. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,95,408.93,413.61,And we can assume that these probabilities sum to one. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,96,413.61,417.0,Because a document won't be able to cover 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,97,417.0,422.52,_other topics outside of the topics that we discussed, that we discovered. _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,98,422.52,428.17,_So now, the question is, how do we define theta sub i, how do we define the topic? _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,99,428.17,431.5,Now this problem has not been completely defined 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,100,431.5,435.18,until we define what is exactly theta. 
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,101,436.97,439.381,_So in the next few lectures, _
3 - 1 - 2.1 Topic Mining and Analysis- Motivation and Task Definition (00-07-36).srt,102,439.381,444.211,we're going to talk about different ways to define theta.
