5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,8,32.66,37.54,_As we discussed earlier, text data can be regarded as data generated _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,9,37.54,41.573,from humans as subjective sensors. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,10,43.45,50.88,_In contrast, we have other devices such as video recorder that can report what's _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,11,50.88,56.67,happening in the real world objective to generate the viewer data for example. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,12,58.29,63.495,_Now the main difference between test data and other data, like video data, _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,13,63.495,70.44,_is that it has rich opinions, _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,14,70.44,75.72,and the content tends to be subjective because it's generated from humans. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,15,76.73,82.17,_Now, this is actually a unique advantaged of text data, as compared with other data, _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,16,82.17,88.19,because the office is a great opportunity to understand the observers.

5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,19,97.10499999999999,103.155,So this lecture and the following lectures will be mainly about how we can mine and 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,20,103.155,107.775,analyze opinions buried in a lot of text data. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,21,109.6,113.036,So let's start with the concept of opinion. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,22,113.036,117.58,_It's not that easy to formally define opinion, but _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,23,117.58,122.34,mostly we would define opinion as a subjective 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,24,122.34,127.0,statement describing what a person believes or thinks about something. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,25,128.77,131.14,_Now, I highlighted quite a few words here. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,26,131.14,135.48,And that's because it's worth thinking a little bit more about these words. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,27,135.48,140.16,And that will help us better understand what's in an opinion. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,28,140.16,145.37,And this further helps us to define opinion more formally. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,29,145.37,150.99,Which is always needed to computation to resolve the problem of opinion mining. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,30,150.99,155.39,So let's first look at the key word of subjective here. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,31,155.39,159.579,This is in contrast with objective statement or factual statement. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,32,160.78,164.13,Those statements can be proved right or wrong. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,33,165.18,169.47,And this is a key differentiating factor from opinions 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,34,169.47,173.52,which tends to be not easy to prove wrong or 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,35,173.52,176.96,_right, because it reflects what the person thinks about something. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,36,179.01,186.64,_So in contrast, objective statement can usually be proved wrong or correct. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,37,187.66,195.17,_For example, you might say this computer has a screen and a battery. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,38,196.7,198.6,Now that's something you can check. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,39,198.6,202.2,It's either having a battery or not. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,40,203.43,208.82,_But in contrast with this, think about the sentence such as, this laptop has _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,41,208.82,214.95,the best battery or this laptop has a nice screen. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,42,214.95,218.629,Now these statements are more subjective and 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,43,218.629,223.29,it's very hard to prove whether it's wrong or correct. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,44,225.68,229.0,_So opinion, is a subjective statement. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,45,230.26,234.45,And next lets look at the keyword person here. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,46,234.45,236.94,And that indicates that is an opinion holder. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,47,236.94,242.31,_Because when we talk about opinion, it's about an opinion held by someone. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,48,242.31,244.66,And then we notice that there is something here. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,49,244.66,246.86,So that is the target of the opinion. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,50,246.86,249.81,The opinion is expressed on this something. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,51,251.44,255.78,_And now, of course, believes or thinks implies that _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,52,255.78,261.01,an opinion will depend on the culture or background and the context in general. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,53,261.01,264.76,Because a person might think different in a different context. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,54,264.76,269.69,People from different background may also think in different ways. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,55,269.69,274.24,So this analysis shows that there are multiple elements that we need to include 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,56,274.24,276.58,in order to characterize opinion. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,57,278.15999999999997,282.47,_So, what's a basic opinion representation like? _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,58,282.47,286.83,_Well, it should include at least three elements, right? _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,59,286.83,289.52,_Firstly, it has to specify what's the opinion holder. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,60,289.52,291.22,So whose opinion is this? 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,61,291.22,295.72,_Second, it must also specify the target, what's this opinion about? _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,62,297.23,300.83,_And third, of course, we want opinion content. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,63,300.83,303.83,And so what exactly is opinion? 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,64,303.83,305.16,_If you can identify these, _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,65,305.16,310.75,we get a basic understanding of opinion and can already be useful sometimes. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,66,310.75,314.13,_You want to understand further, we want enriched opinion representation. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,67,315.21,317.5,_And that means we also want to understand that, for example, _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,68,317.5,322.74,the context of the opinion and what situation was the opinion expressed. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,69,322.74,326.29,_For example, what time was it expressed? _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,70,326.29,332.31,_We, also, would like to, people understand the opinion sentiment, and this is _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,71,332.31,339.37,to understand that what the opinion tells us about the opinion holder's feeling. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,72,339.37,343.65999999999997,_For example, is this opinion positive, or negative? _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,73,343.65999999999997,347.911,_Or perhaps the opinion holder was happy or was sad, and _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,74,347.911,352.813,so such understanding obvious to those beyond just Extracting 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,75,352.813,356.527,_the opinion content, it needs some analysis. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,76,360.484,363.86,So let's take a simple example of a product review. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,77,363.86,369.35,_In this case, this actually expressed the opinion holder, and expressed the target. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,78,369.35,372.14,So its obviously whats opinion holder and 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,79,372.14,376.86,that's just reviewer and its also often very clear whats the opinion target and 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,80,376.86,381.34,that's the product review for example iPhone 6. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,81,381.34,386.21,When the review is posted usually you can't such information easier. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,82,387.35,390.54,_Now the content, of course, is a review text that's, in general, _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,83,390.54,392.29,also easy to obtain. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,84,392.29,395.92,So you can see product reviews are fairly 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,85,395.92,400.64,easy to analyze in terms of obtaining a basic opinion of representation. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,86,400.64,405.73,_But of course, if you want to get more information, you might know the Context, _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,87,405.73,407.3,for example. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,88,407.3,411.17,The review was written in 2015. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,89,411.17,417.19,_Or, we want to know that the sentiment of this review is positive. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,90,417.19,422.499,_So, this additional understanding of course adds value to mining the opinions. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,91,424.34,429.06,_Now, you can see in this case the task is relatively easy and that's _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,92,429.06,433.789,because the opinion holder and the opinion target have already been identified. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,93,434.82,437.23,Now let's take a look at the sentence in the news. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,94,437.23,441.41,_In this case, we have a implicit holder and a implicit target. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,95,441.41,444.99,And the tasker is in general harder. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,96,444.99,451.7,_So, we can identify opinion holder here, and that's the governor of Connecticut. _

5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,100,463.92,465.85,So what's the opinion? 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,101,465.85,469.65999999999997,_Well, there's a negative sentiment here _

5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,105,483.3,488.37,all these elements must be extracted by using natural RAM processing techniques. 
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,106,488.37,491.1,_So, the task Is much harder. _
5 - 1 - 4.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis- Motivation (00-17-51).srt,107,491.1,493.02,And we need a deeper natural language processing.
