5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,3,14.512,18.662,_In the beginning, we talked about the natural language processing and _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,4,18.662,21.025,how it can enrich text representation. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,5,21.025,26.207,_We then talked about how to mine knowledge about the language, _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,6,26.207,29.434,_natural language used to express the, _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,7,29.434,33.27,what's observing the world in text and data. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,8,34.32,38.41,_In particular, we talked about how to mine word associations. _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,9,38.41,42.3,We then talked about how to analyze topics in text. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,10,42.3,45.13,How to discover topics and analyze them. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,11,47.58,51.314,_This can be regarded as knowledge about observed world, _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,12,51.314,55.747,and then we talked about how to mine knowledge about the observer and 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,13,55.747,60.988,_particularly talk about the, how to mine opinions and do sentiment analysis. _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,14,60.988,66.048,_And finally, we will talk about the text-based prediction, which has to _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,15,66.048,71.20400000000001,do with predicting values of other real world variables based on text data. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,16,71.20400000000001,76.27,_And in discussing this, we will also discuss the role of non-text data, _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,17,76.27,81.42099999999999,_which can contribute additional predictors for the prediction problem, _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,18,81.42099999999999,85.425,_and also can provide context for analyzing text data, and _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,19,85.425,90.11,in particular we talked about how to use context to analyze topics. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,20,93.24000000000001,99.078,So here are the key high-level take away messages from this cost. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,21,99.078,101.67,I going to go over these major topics and 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,22,101.67,106.4,point out what are the key take-away messages that you should remember. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,23,107.56,110.63,First the NLP and text representation. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,24,113.53,116.84,You should realize that NLP is always very important for 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,25,116.84,121.51,any text replication because it enriches text representation. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,26,121.51,125.06,The more NLP the better text representation we can have. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,27,125.06,128.5,_And this further enables more accurate knowledge discovery, _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,28,128.5,131.71,_to discover deeper knowledge, buried in text. _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,29,132.95,137.51,_However, the current estate of art of natural energy processing is, _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,30,137.51,139.13,still not robust enough. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,31,139.13,143.586,_So, as an result, the robust text mining technologies today, _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,32,143.586,146.96,tend to be based on world [INAUDIBLE].

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,34,150.71,153.52,as we've discussed in this course. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,35,153.52,159.7,And you may recall we've mostly used word based representations. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,36,159.7,162.478,_And we've relied a lot on statistical techniques, _

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,44,198.84,204.09,And these relations might be also meaningful for other sequences of data. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,45,205.81,209.81,We also talked a lot about test the similarity then we

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,49,219.858,224.437,we talked about representing text data with a vector space model. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,50,224.437,228.638,And we talked about some retrieval techniques such as BM25 for

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,53,235.19299999999998,239.48,And this part is well-connected to text retrieval. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,54,239.48,242.33,There are other techniques that can be relevant here also. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,55,243.89,248.65,_The next point is about co-occurrence analysis of text, and _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,56,248.65,252.77,_we introduce some information theory concepts such as entropy, _

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,62,270.92,274.46,_So this is another important concept, good to know. _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,63,275.48,278.64,_And then we talked about the topic mining and analysis, and _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,64,278.64,281.57,that's where we introduce in the probabilistic topic model. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,65,281.57,285.96,_We spent a lot of time to explain the basic topic model, _

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,68,296.19,301.46,we did not have enough time to really go in depth in introducing LDA. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,69,302.96,306.6,_But in practice, PLSA seems as effective as LDA and _

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,78,340.94,345.02,Then we talked about the text clustering and the text categorization. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,79,345.02,350.45,Those are two important building blocks in any text mining application systems. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,80,350.45,356.11,In text with clustering we talked about how we can solve the problem by 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,81,356.11,362.4,using a slightly different mixture module than the probabilistic topic model.

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,93,412.37,417.1,_In both parts, we'll also discuss how to evaluate the results. _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,94,417.1,423.11,Evaluation is quite important because if the matches that you use don't really 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,95,423.11,427.43,reflect the volatility of the method then it would give you misleading results so 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,96,427.43,430.53,its very important to get the variation right. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,97,430.53,435.42,And we talked about variation of categorization in detail was a lot of

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,99,438.53,441.725,Then we talked about the sentiment analysis and the paradigm and 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,100,441.725,445.053,that's where we introduced sentiment classification problem. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,101,445.053,449.681,_And although it's a special case of text recalculation, but _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,102,449.681,454.932,we talked about how to extend or improve the text recalculation method 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,103,454.932,461.261,by using more sophisticated features that would be needed for sentiment analysis. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,104,461.261,466.24,_We did a review of some common use for complex features for text analysis, and _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,105,466.24,470.836,_then we also talked about how to capture the order of these categories, _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,106,470.836,475.511,_in sentiment classification, and in particular we introduced ordinal _

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,122,541.863,544.565,we talked about the contextual text mining. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,123,544.565,548.921,We introduced the contextual PLSA as a generalizing or generalized model of PLSA

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,155,692.52,694.01,So this is very important. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,156,697.01,699.91,The second area you should look into is the Statistical Machine Learning. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,157,701.12,705.09,And these techniques are now the backbone techniques for

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,169,754.33,758.32,_So that's one example of [INAUDIBLE] techniques that we weren't able to cover, _
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,170,758.32,760.05,but that's also very important. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,171,761.39,765.4,And the other area that has emerged in status learning is the water and

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,179,796.29,800.97,would lead to practical useful techniques that work much better than the current 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,180,800.97,805.172,technologies is still an open question that has to be examined. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,181,805.172,808.0,And no serious evaluation has been done yet.

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,186,823.52,826.86,So its very important to know more about these. 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,187,826.86,830.78,Statistical learning is also the key to predictive modeling which is very crucial 
5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,188,830.78,835.18,for many big data applications and we did not talk about that predictive modeling

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,190,839.994,845.05,techniques and this is another reason why statistical learning is important.

5 - 11 - 4.11 Course Summary (00-18-36).srt,214,947.901,951.521,and this has to do with knowledge providence.
