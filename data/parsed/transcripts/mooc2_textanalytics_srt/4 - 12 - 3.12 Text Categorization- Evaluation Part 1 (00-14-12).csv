4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,1,0.025,4.845,[SOUND] This lecture is about 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,2,4.845,12.188,the Evaluation of Text Categorization. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,3,12.188,15.93,So we've talked about many different methods for text categorization. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,4,15.93,17.9,But how do you know which method works better? 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,5,19.08,20.61,_And for a particular application, _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,6,20.61,25.88,how do you know this is the best way of solving your problem? 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,7,25.88,27.67,_To understand these, we have to _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,8,29.27,34.87,how to we have to know how to evaluate categorization results. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,9,34.87,37.32,So first some general thoughts about the evaluation. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,10,38.65,44.53,_In general, for evaluation of this kind of empirical tasks such as categorization, _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,11,44.53,49.38,we use methodology that was developed in 1960s by 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,12,49.38,51.62,information retrieval researchers. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,13,51.62,53.38,Called a Cranfield Evaluation Methodology. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,14,53.38,58.1,_The basic idea is to have humans create test correction, _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,15,59.88,64.55,_where, we already know, every document is tagged with the desired categories. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,16,64.55,68.68,_Or, in the case of search, for which query, which documents that should have _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,17,68.68,72.08,_been retrieved, and this is called, a ground truth. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,18,72.08,74.74,_Now, with this ground truth test correction, _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,19,74.74,79.95,we can then reuse the collection to test the many different systems and 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,20,79.95,81.9,then compare different systems. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,21,81.9,86.28999999999999,We can also turn off some components in the system to see what's going to happen. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,22,86.28999999999999,94.69,Basically it provides a way to do control experiments to compare different methods. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,23,96.57,99.91,So this methodology has been virtually used for 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,24,99.91,104.45,all the tasks that involve empirically defined problems. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,25,105.95,110.81,_So in our case, then, we are going to compare our systems categorization _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,26,110.81,115.53,_results with the categorization, ground truth, created by humans. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,27,116.72999999999999,119.569,_And we're going to compare our systems decisions, _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,28,120.82,124.54,which documents should get which category with what 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,29,126.12,129.62,categories have been assigned to those documents by humans. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,30,129.62,134.93,And we want to quantify the similarity of these decisions or 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,31,134.93,139.2,_equivalently, to measure the difference between the system output and _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,32,139.2,143.67000000000002,the desired ideal output generated by the humans. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,33,145.02,149.04,_So obviously, the highest similarity is the better results are. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,34,150.1,153.8,The similarity could be measured in different ways. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,35,153.8,155.76,And that would lead to different measures. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,36,155.76,160.87,And sometimes it's desirable also to match the similarity from different perspectives 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,37,160.87,164.66,just to have a better understanding of the results in detail. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,38,164.66,169.37,_For example, we might be also interested in knowing which category performs _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,39,169.37,172.85,_better and which which category is easy to categorize, etc. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,40,172.85,178.89,_In general, different categorization mistakes _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,41,178.89,183.57,_however, have different costs for specific applications. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,42,183.57,186.71,So some areas might be more serious than others. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,43,186.71,192.08,_So ideally, we would like to model such differences, but if you read _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,44,192.08,196.2,many papers in categorization you will see that they don't generally do that. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,45,196.2,202.027,_Instead, they will use a simplified measure and that's because it's _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,46,202.027,208.144,often okay not to consider such a cost variation when we compare methods and 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,47,208.144,214.478,when we are interested in knowing the relative difference of these methods. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,48,214.478,219.61599999999999,_So it's okay to introduce some bias, as long as the bias is not already with _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,49,219.61599999999999,224.677,a particular method and then we should expect the more effective method to 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,50,224.677,230.41,_perform better than a less effective one, even though the measure is not perfect. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,51,233.11,236.62,So the first measure that we'll introduce is called classification accuracy and 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,52,236.62,240.37,this is a basic into measure the percentage of correct decisions. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,53,240.37,244.99,So here you see that there are categories denoted by c1 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,54,244.99,250.62,_through ck and there are n documents, denoted by d1 through d N. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,55,250.62,252.47,And for each pair of category and 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,56,252.47,254.92,_the document, we can then look at the situation. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,57,256.71,261.06,_And see if the system has said yes to this pair, _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,58,261.06,263.66,basically has assigned this category to this document. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,59,263.66,269.06,_Or no, so this is denoted by Y or M, that's the systems of the decision. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,60,269.06,274.29,_And similarly, we can look at the human's decisions also, if the human has assigned _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,61,274.29,277.81,a category to the document of that there will be a plus sign here. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,62,277.81,280.65999999999997,That just means that a human. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,63,280.65999999999997,286.36,We think of this assignment is correct and incorrect then it's a minus. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,64,286.36,293.70799999999997,_So we'll see all combinations of this Ns, yes and nos, minus and pluses. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,65,293.70799999999997,296.178,There are four combinations in total. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,66,296.178,301.041,_And two of them are correct, and that's when we have y(+) or n(-), _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,67,301.041,304.57,and then there are also two kinds of errors. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,68,304.57,307.64,So the measure of classification accuracy is simply to count 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,69,307.64,310.31,how many of these decisions are correct. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,70,310.31,314.05,And normalize that by the total number of decisions we have made. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,71,314.05,319.18,_So, we know that the total number of decisions is n, multiplied by k. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,72,320.31,325.09,_And, the number of correct decisions are basically of two kinds. _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,73,325.09,326.58,One is y plusses. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,74,326.58,328.3,And the other is n minus this n. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,75,328.3,330.72,We just put together the count. 
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,76,330.72,334.8,_Now, this is a very convenient measure that will give us one number _
4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,77,334.8,338.14,to characterize performance of a method.

4 - 12 - 3.12 Text Categorization- Evaluation Part 1 (00-14-12).srt,79,341.19,344.53,But the method also has some problems.
