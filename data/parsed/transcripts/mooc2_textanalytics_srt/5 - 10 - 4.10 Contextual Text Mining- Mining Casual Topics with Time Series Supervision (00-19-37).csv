5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,54,223.09,227.96,That's why we put causal in quotation marks. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,55,227.96,231.6,But at least they are correlating topics that might potentially

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,61,253.45,257.27,rather they have to explain the data in the text. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,62,257.27,261.477,Meaning that they have to reprehend the meaningful topics in text.

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,64,263.87,269.76,they should be correlated with external hand series that's given as a context. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,65,269.76,273.58,_So to understand how we solve this problem, let's first adjust to _

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,67,276.93,280.33,And we can apply this to text stream and 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,68,280.33,284.26,with some extension like a CPRSA or Contextual PRSA. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,69,284.26,289.33,Then we can discover these topics in the correlation and 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,70,289.33,291.44,also discover their coverage over time. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,71,293.26,299.3,_So, one simple solution is, to choose the topics from _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,72,299.3,304.0,this set that have the strongest correlation with the external time series. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,73,305.23,308.09,But this approach is not going to be very good. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,74,308.09,309.05,Why? Because 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,75,309.05,313.15,awareness pictured to the topics is that they will discover by PRSA or LDA. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,76,313.15,317.64,And that means the choice of topics will be very limited. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,77,317.64,320.905,And we know these models try to maximize the likelihood of the text data. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,78,320.905,324.685,So those topics tend to be the major topics that explain the text data well. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,79,324.685,328.71,aAnd they are not necessarily correlated with time series.

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,81,334.8,336.17,interesting from causal perspective. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,82,337.84000000000003,342.74,_So here in this work site here, a better approach was proposed. _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,83,342.74,346.32,And this approach is called Iterative Causal Topic Modeling. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,84,346.32,350.815,_The idea is to do an iterative adjustment of topic, _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,85,350.815,356.1,discovered by topic models using time series to induce a product. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,86,357.26,360.59,_So here's an illustration on how this work, how this works. _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,87,360.59,362.63,Take the text stream as input and 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,88,362.63,366.14,then apply regular topic modeling to generate a number of topics. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,89,366.14,367.3,Let's say four topics. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,90,367.3,367.81,Shown here. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,91,369.04,374.54,And then we're going to use external time series to assess 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,92,374.54,379.14,which topic is more causally related or correlated with the external time series. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,93,379.14,381.8,So we have something that rank them. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,94,381.8,384.972,And we might think that topic one and topic four are more correlated and 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,95,384.972,386.83,topic two and topic three are not. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,96,386.83,389.66,Now we could have stopped here and 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,97,389.66,393.53,that would be just like what the simple approached that I talked about earlier 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,98,393.53,398.15,then we can get to these topics and call them causal topics. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,99,398.15,401.68,But as I also explained that these topics are unlikely very good 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,100,401.68,405.85,because they are general topics that explain the whole text connection. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,101,405.85,406.7,They are not necessary. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,102,406.7,410.18,The best topics are correlated with our time series. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,103,411.43,417.46,So what we can do in this approach is to first zoom into word level and 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,104,417.46,422.83,we can look into each word and the top ranked word listed for each topic. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,105,422.83,427.81,Let's say we take Topic 1 as the target examined. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,106,427.81,433.03,We know Topic 1 is correlated with the time series. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,107,433.03,437.39,Or is at least the best that we could get from this set of topics so far. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,108,438.49,442.59,_And we're going to look at the words in this topic, the top words. _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,109,443.81,446.12,_And if the topic is correlated with the Time Series, _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,110,446.12,450.74,there must be some words that are highly correlated with the Time Series. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,111,450.74,455.48,_So here, for example, we might discover W1 and W3 are positively _

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,113,461.64,467.18,_So, as a topic, and it's not good to mix these words with different correlations. _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,114,467.18,470.3,So we can then for the separate of these words. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,115,470.3,474.98,We are going to get all the red words that indicate positive correlations.

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,121,494.04,500.1,_analysis, are topics that are still quite related to the original topic, Topic 1. _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,122,500.1,501.95,_But they are already deviating, _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,123,501.95,508.26,because of the use of time series information for bias selection of words. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,124,508.26,513.31,_So then in some sense, well we should expect so, some sense _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,125,513.31,517.86,more correlated with the time series than the original Topic 1. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,126,517.86,521.56,_Because the Topic 1 has mixed words, here we separate them. _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,127,522.65,525.21,So each of these two subtopics 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,128,526.21,529.69,can be expected to be better coherent in this time series.

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,130,532.93,537.76,So the idea here is to go back to topic model by using these 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,131,537.76,542.37,each as a prior to further guide the topic modeling. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,132,542.37,546.14,And that's to say we ask our topic models now discover topics that 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,133,546.14,550.08,are very similar to each of these two subtopics. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,134,550.08,557.11,And this will cause a bias toward more correlate to the topics was a time series. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,135,557.11,561.66,Of course then we can apply topic models to get another generation of topics. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,136,561.66,565.772,And that can be further ran to the base of the time series to set after the highly

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,138,567.227,572.18,And then we can further analyze the components at work in the topic and

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,140,575.38,579.84,And then get the even more correlated subtopics that can be

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,142,586.0,590.46,So this whole process is just a heuristic way of optimizing causality and 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,143,590.46,592.84,_coherence, and that's our ultimate goal. _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,144,592.84,593.88,Right? 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,145,593.88,598.55,So here you see the pure topic models will be very good at

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,151,617.82,620.33,_So, that would be at the other extreme, on the top. _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,152,621.49,625.43,_Now, the ideal is to get the causal topic that's scored high, _

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,155,630.18,635.69,it can be regarded as an alternate way to maximize both sine engines. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,156,635.69,640.21,So when we apply the topic models we're maximizing the coherence. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,157,640.21,644.2,But when we decompose the topic model words into sets 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,158,644.2,647.76,of words that are very strong correlated with the time series. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,159,647.76,651.23,We select the most strongly correlated words with the time series. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,160,651.23,654.83,We are pushing the model back to the causal 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,161,654.83,658.82,dimension to make it better in causal scoring. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,162,658.82,664.02,_And then, when we apply the selected words as a prior _

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,166,680.52,685.445,So the only I think a component that you haven't seen such a framework is how 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,167,685.445,687.38,to measure the causality. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,168,687.38,690.66,Because the rest is just talking more on. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,169,690.66,693.05,So let's have a little bit of discussion of that. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,170,693.05,694.05,So here we show that. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,171,694.05,696.64,And let's say we have a topic about government response here. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,172,696.64,700.78,And then we just talking more of we can get coverage of the topic over time. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,173,700.78,702.24,_So, we have a time series, X sub t. _

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,177,712.783,717.56,Now the the question here is does Xt cause Yt? 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,178,718.68,723.56,_Well in other words, we want to match the causality relation between the two. _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,179,723.56,727.21,Or maybe just measure the correlation of the two. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,180,728.36,731.84,There are many measures that we can use in this framework.

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,182,734.48,737.34,And we got to consider time lag here so 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,183,737.34,739.8,that we can try to capture causal relation. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,184,739.8,745.41,Using somewhat past data and using the data in the past 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,185,746.79,750.99,to try to correlate with the data on

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,189,765.06,770.85,_But a common use, the measure for causality here is Granger Causality Test. _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,190,772.5,775.04,And the idea of this test is actually quite simple. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,191,775.04,778.71,Basically you're going to have all the regressive model to 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,192,778.71,783.0,use the history information of Y to predict itself. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,193,783.0,786.2,And this is the best we could without any other information. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,194,786.2,788.47,So we're going to build such a model. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,195,788.47,792.83,And then we're going to add some history information of X into such model. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,196,792.83,796.34,To see if we can improve the prediction of Y. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,197,796.34,801.17,If we can do that with a statistically significant difference. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,198,801.17,805.7,_Then we just say X has some causal inference on Y, _
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,199,805.7,810.57,or otherwise it wouldn't have causal improvement of prediction of Y.

5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,201,815.67,819.15,that would mean X does not really have a cause or relation why. 
5 - 10 - 4.10 Contextual Text Mining- Mining Casual Topics with Time Series Supervision (00-19-37).srt,202,819.15,820.91,So that's the basic idea.
